1
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
How's your blog going?

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,960
Yeah, good, very good.

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,600
You haven't written a word, have you?

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,440
You just wrote
"still has trust issues".

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,520
And you read my writing upside down.

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,160
You see what I mean?

7
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,080
John, you're a soldier

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,720
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,520
and writing a blog about everything that
happens to you will honestly help you.

10
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,000
Nothing happens to me.

11
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
'What do you mean there's no ruddy
car?' He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
Get a cab! I never get cabs!

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,560
I love you. When?

14
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
Get a cab!

15
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,320
My husband

16
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,560
was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

17
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,880
He loved his family and his work,

18
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,400
and that he should have
taken his own life in this way

19
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,440
is a mystery

20
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
and a shock to all who knew him.

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
Taxi, taxi!

22
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I'll be just two minutes, mate.
What?

23
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,560
I'm just going home to get
my umbrella. You can share mine.

24
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
Two minutes, all right?

25
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
She still dancing?

26
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Yeah, if you can call it that.

27
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
Did you get the car keys off her?
Got them out of her bag.

28
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
Where is she?

29
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,600
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

30
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,240
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

31
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,920
Preliminary investigations
suggest that this was suicide.

32
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,880
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those of

33
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,600
Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

34
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,240
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

35
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,240
The investigation is ongoing but Detective
Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.

36
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,600
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

37
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
Well, they all took the same poison.

38
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,920
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

39
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,120
None of them had shown any prior indication.
But you can't have serial suicides.

40
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
Well, apparently you can.

41
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

42
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,360
There's no link we've found yet but

43
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,560
we're looking for it.
There has to be one.

44
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,920
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them. It just says "Wrong".

45
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,320
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions,

46
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

47
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,600
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

48
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,920
As I say, these suicides
are clearly linked.

49
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,600
It's an unusual situation, we've
got our best people investigating.

50
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,480
Says "Wrong" again.

51
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,680
One more question. Is there any
chance that these are murders?

52
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,480
And if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

53
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,320
I know that you like writing about these
but these do appear to be suicides.

54
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,360
We know the difference. The poison
was clearly self-administered.

55
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

56
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,920
Well, don't commit suicide.

57
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,320
Daily Mail!

58
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,160
This is a frightening time for people but all
anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.

59
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,040
We are all as safe as we want to be.

60
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,440
MOBILE PHONES BUZZ

61
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,040
Thank you.

62
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,120
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

63
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,680
If you can tell me
how he does it, I'll stop him.

64
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,800
John!

65
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,440
John Watson!

66
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
Stamford, Mike Stamford. We were at Barts
together. Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

67
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes, I know, I got fat. No, no.

68
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,480
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

69
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,920
I got shot.

70
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,920
Are you still at Barts then?

71
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,240
Teaching now, yeah, bright
young things like we used to be.

72
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,320
God, I hate them.

73
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,040
What about you, just staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

74
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

75
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,480
Couldn't bear to be anywhere else. That's not
the John Watson I know. I'm not the John Watson.

76
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,920
Couldn't Harry help?

77
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, like that's going to happen.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,040
I don't know,
get a flatshare or something?

79
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

80
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
What?

81
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,600
Who was the first?

83
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,160
How fresh?

84
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,040
Just in. 67, natural causes.

85
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,200
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

86
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,440
Fine.

87
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,640
We'll start with the riding crop.

88
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,440
So, bad day was it?

89
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,560
I need to know what bruises form in the next 20
minutes. A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

90
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,840
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

91
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,920
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

92
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I refreshed it a bit.

93
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,440
Sorry, you were saying?

94
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,200
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee?

95
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,920
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

96
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,550
OK.

97
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
KNOCK ON DOOR

98
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,640
Bit different from my day.
You've no idea!

99
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,800
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

100
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
And what's wrong with the landline?
I prefer to text.

101
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,840
Sorry, it's in my coat.

102
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,640
Here, use mine.

103
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
Oh, thank you.

104
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,280
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

105
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,680
Afghanistan or Iraq?

106
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,840
Sorry?
Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

107
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,160
Afghanistan, sorry,
how did you know?

108
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,320
Ah! Coffee, thank you.

109
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
What happened to the lipstick?

110
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,680
It wasn't working for me.

111
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,920
Really? It was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

112
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,670
OK.

113
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,080
How do you feel about the violin?

114
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm sorry, what?

115
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,800
I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes I
don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you?

116
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

117
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,800
You told him about me? Not a word.

118
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,680
Who said anything about flatmates?

119
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,040
I did. Told Mike this morning that I must
be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

120
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,280
Now here he is just after lunch with
an old friend clearly just home from

121
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,080
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn't a difficult leap.

122
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,560
How did you know about Afghanistan?

123
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

124
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,440
We ought to be able to afford it.

125
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,560
We'll meet there tomorrow
evening, seven o'clock.

126
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,440
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

127
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
Is that it?

128
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
Is that what?

129
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,680
We've only just met and we're
going to go and look at a flat?

130
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
Problem?

131
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,560
We don't know
a thing about each other.

132
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,040
I don't know where we're meeting,
I don't even know your name.

133
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,080
I know you're an Army doctor and you've
been invalided home from Afghanistan.

134
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,200
You've got a brother worried about you but
you won't go to him for help because you don't

135
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,840
approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic,
more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.

136
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,440
And I know that your therapist thinks your
limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.

137
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,920
That's enough to be going
on with, don't you think?

138
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,080
The name's Sherlock Holmes
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

139
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,640
Afternoon.

140
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,320
Yeah, he's always like that.

141
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
Hello.

142
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Ah - Mr Holmes. Sherlock, please.

143
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,920
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

144
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

145
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,680
Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband
got himself sentenced to death in Florida.

146
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,640
I was able to help out. Sorry - you
stopped her husband being executed?

147
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,160
Oh, no, I ensured it.

148
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,800
Sherlock!

149
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

150
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Hello. Come in. Thank you.
Shall we...?

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
Well, this could be very nice.

152
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
Very nice indeed.

153
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Yes.

154
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,320
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

155
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,160
TOGETHER: So I went straight ahead and moved in.
Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out...

156
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,400
So this is all... Well, obviously I
can erm...straighten things up a bit.

157
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,440
That's a skull. Friend of mine.

158
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,080
When I say friend...

159
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,160
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

160
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,160
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

161
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Of course we'll be needing two.

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,040
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.
Mrs Turner next door's got (married ones).

163
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,840
Oh...
Sherlock! The mess you've made.

164
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,040
I looked you up on
the internet last night.

165
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Anything interesting? Found your
website. The Science of Deduction.

166
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,840
What did you think?

167
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,800
You said you could identify a software designer
by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb?

168
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes.

169
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

170
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,800
and your brother's drinking habits
on your mobile phone.

171
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,920
How?

172
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,960
What about these suicides then, Sherlock?
I thought that'd be right up your street.

173
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,520
Three exactly the same.

174
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,760
Four.

175
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,320
There's been a fourth. And there's
something different this time. A fourth?

176
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,960
Where? Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

177
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,800
What's new about this one? You
wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

178
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,520
You know how they never leave notes?
Yeah. This one did.

179
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,440
Will you come?

180
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
Who's on forensics? Anderson.

181
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,040
He doesn't work well with me.

182
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
Well, he won't be your assistant.
I NEED an assistant.

183
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,280
Will you come? Not in a police car,
I'll be right behind.

184
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,040
Thank you.

185
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Brilliant! Yes!

186
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

187
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,080
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

188
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

189
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,440
Something cold will do. John, have
a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

190
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,200
Don't wait up!

191
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,760
Look at him, dashing about...

192
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,800
My husband was just the same. But you're
more the sitting-down type, I can tell.

193
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,920
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

194
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry -

195
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
It's just sometimes
this bloody thing...

196
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

197
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you. Just
this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper.

198
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,040
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got 'em. Not your housekeeper!

199
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,200
You're a doctor.

200
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,920
In fact you're an Army doctor.

201
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Yes.

202
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,800
Any good?

203
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,800
Very good.

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,600
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

205
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,640
Well, yes.

206
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,280
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

207
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,560
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

208
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Want to see some more? Oh, God, yes.

209
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,360
Sorry Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out. Both of you?

210
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,720
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

211
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
No point sitting at home when there's
finally something fun going on!

212
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
Look at you, all happy. It's not
decent. Who cares about decent?

213
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,640
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

214
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,800
Taxi!

215
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,040
OK, You've got questions...

216
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,080
Yeah, where are we going?

217
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,560
Crime scene. Next?

218
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
Who are you, what do you do?
What do you think?

219
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,320
I'd say...private detective. But?

220
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,240
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

221
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm a consulting detective. Only
one in the world, I invented the job.

222
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,200
What does that mean? Means when the police
are out of their depth, which is always,

223
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,120
they consult me.
The police don't consult amateurs.

224
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,040
When I met you for the first time yesterday, I
said Afghanistan or Iraq. You looked surprised.

225
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,120
Yes, how DID you know?
I didn't know, I saw.

226
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,040
'Your haircut, the way
you hold yourself says military.

227
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,560
'But your conversation...'
Bit different from my day.

228
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,480
..said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

229
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,240
'Your face is tanned...

230
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
'but no tan above the wrists. You've
been abroad, but not sunbathing.

231
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,720
'Your limp's really bad when you walk, but
you don't ask for a chair when you stand -

232
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
'so it's at least partly
psychosomatic.

233
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,840
'That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic -'

234
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,800
wounded in action then. Wounded in
action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

235
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,520
You said I had a therapist.

236
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,600
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

237
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,520
Then there's your brother. Mm?
Your phone.

238
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,560
'It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.'

239
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,800
And you're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

240
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,040
'Scratches.
Not one, many over time -'

241
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,000
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

242
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

243
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,320
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

244
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,840
The engraving?

245
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,880
Harry Watson. Clearly a family
member who's given you his old phone.

246
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,120
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

247
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,200
Could be a cousin, but you're a war
hero who can't find a place to live -

248
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
unlikely you've got an extended family,
not one you're close to. So brother it is.

249
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,040
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

250
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,480
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

251
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,040
Must have given it to him recently,
it's only six months old.

252
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,720
Marriage in trouble then -
six months on he's given it away.

253
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,000
If she'd left HIM,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

254
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,840
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

255
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,320
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

256
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,480
You're looking for cheap accommodation, but
you're not going to your brother for help -

257
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,040
that says you've got problems with him. Maybe
you liked his wife, or don't like his drinking.

258
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,120
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

259
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

260
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,560
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round it.

261
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,040
Every night he plugs it in
but his hands are shaking.

262
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,120
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

263
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,520
never see a drunk's without them. There you go,
you were right. I was right? Right about what?

264
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,800
The police don't consult amateurs.

265
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,280
That...was amazing.

266
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,600
Do you think so? Of course it was. It was
extraordinary, it was quite extraordinary.

267
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,520
That's not what people normally say.
What do people normally say?

268
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,000
Piss off!

269
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,480
Did I get anything wrong?

270
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,360
Harry and me don't get on,
never have,

271
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,560
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

272
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,600
and they're getting a divorce,

273
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,080
and Harry is a drinker.

274
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,840
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

275
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,800
Harry's short for Harriet.

276
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,600
Harry's your sister. Look, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing here? Sister!

277
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,040
No - seriously, what am I doing
here? There's always something.

278
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,640
Hello, freak! I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

279
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,200
Why?

280
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,360
I was invited.

281
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Why?
I think he wants me to take a look.

282
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,880
Well, you know what I think,
don't you? Always Sally.

283
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
I even know you didn't
make it home last night.

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,800
I don't... Who's this?
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

285
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

286
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,200
Old friend.

287
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,840
A colleague(?)
How do YOU get a colleague?

288
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
Did he follow you home?

289
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,760
Would it be better
if I just waited... No.

290
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,840
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

291
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,520
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

292
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,400
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

293
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,560
Quite clear.

294
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,400
And is your wife away for long?

295
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,080
Oh, don't pretend you worked
that out. Somebody told you that.

296
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,520
Your deodorant told me that.

297
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,600
My deodorant?

298
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,400
It's for men. Well, of course
it's for men - I'm wearing it.

299
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,640
So's Sergeant Donovan.

300
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,040
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

301
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,560
Whatever you're trying to imply...

302
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came round
for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over.

303
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
And I assume she scrubbed your floors,
going by the state of her knees.

304
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,840
You'll need to wear one of these.

305
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,320
Who's this?

306
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,840
He's with me.

307
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,520
But who is he? I said he's with me.

308
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,800
Aren't you going to put one on?

309
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,520
So where are we? Upstairs.

310
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,080
I can give you two minutes.

311
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,400
May need longer.

312
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,080
Her name's Jennifer Wilson
according to her credit cards,

313
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,800
we're running them now
for contact details.

314
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,560
Hasn't been here long.

315
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,120
Some kids found her.

316
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,560
Shut up.

317
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,040
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking. It's annoying.

318
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,520
Got anything?

319
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Not much.

320
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,720
She's German.

321
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,280
Rache. It's German for revenge. She
could be trying to tell us something...

322
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,240
Yes, thank you for your input.

323
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,520
So she's German? Of course she's
not. She's from out of town though.

324
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,240
Intended to stay in London
for one night

325
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
before returning home to Cardiff.
So far, so obvious.

326
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,400
Sorry - obvious?
What about the message though?

327
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,880
Dr Watson, what do you think?

328
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,280
Of the message?
Of the body. You're a medical man.

329
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,840
We have a whole team right outside.

330
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,960
They won't work with me. I'm breaking
every rule letting YOU in here...

331
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,320
Yes...because you need me.

332
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,720
Yes, I do.

333
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,000
God help me.

334
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,760
Dr Watson! Hm?

335
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,520
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

336
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,360
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

337
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,720
Well? What am I doing here?

338
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,400
Helping me make a point. I'm supposed to be
helping you pay the rent. This is more fun.

339
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,760
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

340
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,280
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I WAS hoping you'd go deeper.

341
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,560
Yeah...

342
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,120
Asphyxiation, probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

343
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,840
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

344
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,040
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

345
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,000
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

346
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,240
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

347
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Sherlock - two minutes, I said,
I need anything you got.

348
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,800
Victim is in her late 30s. Professional
person, going by her clothes -

349
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,080
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

350
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,400
Travelled from Cardiff today intending to stay
in London one night from the size of her suitcase.

351
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,040
Suitcase? Yes. She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

352
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,800
She's had a string of lovers but
none of them knew she was married.

353
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,080
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

354
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,640
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

355
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,960
The rest of her jewellery has been
regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring.

356
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,760
The inside
is shinier than the outside.

357
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,480
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

358
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,840
It's not for work, look at her nails. She doesn't work
with her hands so who DOES she remove her rings for?

359
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,560
Not ONE lover, she'd never sustain the
fiction of being single for that long

360
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
so more likely a string of them.
Brilliant.

361
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
Sorry. Cardiff?

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,240
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's not obvious to me.

363
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,520
Dear God, what is it like in your funny
little brains, it must be so boring. Her coat -

364
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,240
it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain the last few hours -

365
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,960
no rain anywhere in London
in that time.

366
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,560
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

367
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,120
She's got an umbrella in her pocket
but it's dry and unused.

368
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,720
Not just wind, strong wind -
too strong to use her umbrella.

369
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,600
We know from her suitcase that
she was intending to stay overnight

370
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,000
but she can't have travelled more than two or
three hours because her coat still hasn't dried.

371
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,120
So
- where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?

372
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,480
Cardiff.

373
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,800
Fantastic.
Do you know you do that out loud?

374
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
Sorry, I'll shut up.
No, it's...fine.

375
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,480
Why do you keep saying suitcase?
Yes, where is it?

376
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,520
She must have had a phone or an organiser.
Find out who Rachel is. She was writing Rachel?

377
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,200
No, she was leaving an angry note in German
- of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be.

378
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,080
Why did she wait until she was dying to
write it? How do you know she had a suitcase?

379
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,120
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

380
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,720
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her
with her right hand, by that splash pattern.

381
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,840
Smallish case, going by the spread.

382
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious -

383
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,560
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

384
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,040
Where is it,
what have you done with it?

385
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
There wasn't a case.

386
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,840
Say that again. There wasn't a case.
There was never any suitcase.

387
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,320
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

388
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,960
Sir, there was no case!

389
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,720
But they take the poison themselves,
swallow the pills.

390
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,280
There are clear signs, even you lot
couldn't miss them. Right, thanks. And...?

391
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,360
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

392
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

393
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,080
We've got a serial killer. There's
always something to look forward to.

394
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,120
Why are you saying that?
Her case! Come on, where is her case?

395
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,080
Did she eat it(?) Someone else
was here, and they took her case.

396
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,240
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

397
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,400
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

398
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,520
No, look at her hair. She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and her shoes.

399
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,280
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

400
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,760
Oh...

401
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,550
Oh!

402
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Sherlock? What is it, what?

403
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,560
Serial killers, always hard. You have
to wait for them to make a mistake.

404
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,720
We can't just wait! Oh, we're done
waiting. Look at her, really look!

405
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,000
Houston, we have a mistake.
Get on to Cardiff.

406
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,080
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

407
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,000
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

408
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Pink!

409
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
ANDERSON: Let's get on with it...

410
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
He's gone. Who, Sherlock Holmes?

411
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,320
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

412
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,400
Is he coming back?
Didn't look like it.

413
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,360
Right.

414
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,080
Right...

415
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

416
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,640
Brixton.

417
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,560
Do you know where I could get a cab?

418
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,800
It's just er...

419
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
well -

420
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,080
my leg.

421
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,960
Er...

422
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,040
..try the main road.

423
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
Thanks.

424
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,800
But you're not his friend.

425
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,760
He doesn't HAVE friends.

426
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,880
So who are you?

427
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

428
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
OK, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.

429
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Why?

430
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,880
You know why he's here?

431
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,200
He's not paid or anything.

432
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,520
He likes it. He gets off on it.

433
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,960
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

434
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,080
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

435
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,360
One day we'll be standing round a body
and he'll be the one that put it there.

436
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,480
Why would he do that?
Because he's a psychopath.

437
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,040
Psychopaths get bored.

438
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,000
LESTRADE: Donovan! Coming.

439
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,480
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,520
CAMERA WHIRS

460
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,480
How are you doing this?

461
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,680
'Get into the car, Dr Watson.

462
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,200
'I would make some sort of threat, but I'm
sure your situation is quite clear to you.'

463
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,200
Hello. Hi.

464
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
What's your name, then?

465
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,200
Er...Anthea.

466
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,000
Is that your real name? No.

467
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
I'm John.

468
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
Yes. I know.

469
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,720
Any point in asking...
where I'm going?

470
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,600
None at all...

471
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,840
John.

472
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,870
OK.

473
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,360
Have a seat, John.

474
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
You know, I've got a phone.

475
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,800
I mean, very clever and all that,

476
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,880
but er...

477
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,600
you could just phone me.

478
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,000
On my phone.

479
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,800
When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock
Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place.

480
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,640
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

481
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,120
I don't want to sit down.

482
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,520
You don't seem very afraid.

483
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,240
You don't seem very frightening.

484
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,840
HE CHUCKLES
Yes...

485
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,800
The bravery of the soldier.

486
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,360
Bravery is by far the kindest
word for stupidity, don't you think?

487
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,840
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

488
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,480
I don't have one. I barely know him,
I met him...yesterday.

489
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,800
Mmm, and since yesterday you've moved in with
him and now you're solving crimes together.

490
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,120
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

491
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,640
Who are you? An interested party.

492
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,600
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

493
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,680
I'm guessing you're not friends.

494
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,080
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

495
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,720
I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock
Holmes is capable of having. And what's that?

496
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,360
An enemy. An enemy?

497
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,280
In HIS mind, certainly.

498
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,880
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

499
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,800
He does love to be dramatic.

500
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,120
Well, thank God
YOU'RE above all that.

501
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,920
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

502
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,360
I hope I'm not distracting you.

503
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,800
Not distracting me at all.

504
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,880
Do you plan to continue your
association with Sherlock Holmes?

505
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,200
I could be wrong...

506
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,720
but I think that's
none of your business.

507
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,400
It could be. It really couldn't.

508
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,320
If you DO move into, erm...

509
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,360
..221B Baker Street,

510
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,640
I'd be happy to

511
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,320
pay you a meaningful sum of money
on a regular basis to ease your way.

512
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,680
Why?

513
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,320
Because you're not a wealthy man.

514
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,880
In exchange for what?

515
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,640
Information.

516
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,120
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing
you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

517
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,840
Just tell me what he's up to. Why?

518
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,320
I worry about him. Constantly.

519
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,000
That's nice of you.

520
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,440
But I would prefer for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned,

521
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,720
we have what you might call a...
difficult relationship.

522
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,920
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

523
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,520
No.
But I haven't mentioned a figure.

524
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,280
Don't bother.

525
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,320
You're very loyal VERY quickly.

526
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,120
No, I'm not,
I'm just not interested.

527
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,960
"Trust issues"...it says here.

528
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,840
What's that?

529
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Could it be that you've decided to
trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

530
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,800
Who says I trust him? You don't seem
the kind to make friends easily.

531
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,640
Are we done?

532
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,680
You tell me.

533
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,880
I imagine people have already
warned you to stay away from him,

534
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,120
but I can see from your left hand
that's not going to happen.

535
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,720
My what? Show me.

536
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,640
Don't...

537
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,160
Remarkable. What is?

538
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,800
Most people...blunder round this city, and
all they see are streets and shops and cars.

539
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,680
When you walk with Sherlock
Holmes, you see the battlefield.

540
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

541
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,240
What's wrong with my hand?

542
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,800
You have an intermittent tremor
in your left hand.

543
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,880
Your therapist thinks it's
post-traumatic stress disorder.

544
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,800
She thinks you're haunted by
memories of your military service.

545
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,320
Who the hell are you?

546
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,640
How do you know that? Fire her.
She's got it the wrong way round.

547
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,320
You're under stress right now
and your hand is perfectly steady.

548
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,960
You're not haunted by the war,
Dr Watson...

549
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,440
You miss it.

550
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Welcome back.

551
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,800
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

552
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

553
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm to take you home.

554
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,520
Address?

555
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,720
Er, Baker Street.

556
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,400
221B Baker Street.

557
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,920
But I need to stop off
somewhere first.

558
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Listen, your boss. Any chance you could
not tell him this is where I went?

559
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,960
Sure. You've told him
already, haven't you?

560
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,400
Yeah.

561
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,960
Hey erm...
do you ever get any free time?

562
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,280
SHE CHUCKLES
Oh, yeah. Lots.

563
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,080
Bye... OK.

564
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,320
HE EXHALES SLOWLY

565
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,880
What are you doing?

566
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,480
Nicotine patch.

567
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,920
Helps me think.

568
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,720
Impossible to sustain a smoking
habit in London these days.

569
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,440
Bad news for brain work.

570
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,480
It's good news for breathing.
Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

571
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,320
Is that...three patches?

572
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,120
It's a three-patch problem.

573
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,440
Well...?

574
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,400
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

575
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,600
Oh - yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

576
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,440
My phone? Always a chance that my number
will be recognised. It's on the website.

577
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,400
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
Yeah, she's downstairs.

578
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,520
I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
I WAS the other side of London...

579
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,320
There was no hurry.

580
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,800
Here...

581
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,680
So what's this about - the case?

582
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,120
Her case... HER case?
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

583
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,600
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

584
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,240
OK, he took her case. So?

585
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,400
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

586
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,920
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

587
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,880
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

588
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,400
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

589
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,240
What's wrong?
Just met a friend of yours.

590
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,200
A friend? An enemy.

591
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,680
Oh. Which one?

592
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,840
Well, your arch-enemy, according to
him. Do people have arch-enemies?

593
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,600
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

594
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,440
Yes. Did you take it?

595
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,440
No. Pity, we could have split the
fee. Think it through next time.

596
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,800
Who is he? The most dangerous man you've
ever met, and not my problem right now.

597
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,400
On my desk, the number!

598
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,680
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

599
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,840
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

600
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,760
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

601
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,200
Are you doing it? Yes.
Have you done it?

602
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,640
Yeah - hang on!

603
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,280
These words exactly.

604
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,720
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

605
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
"I must have blacked out.

606
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,640
"22 Northumberland Street,

607
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,200
please come." You blacked out?

608
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,480
What? No... No!

609
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,280
Type and send it. Quickly.

610
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,320
Have you sent it? What's the address?

611
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,720
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

612
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,280
That's...

613
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,240
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

614
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,600
Yes, obviously.

615
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Oh, perhaps I should mention
- I didn't kill her. I never said you did.

616
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,400
Why not? Given that text and the fact I have
her case it's a perfectly logical assumption.

617
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,720
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

618
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,320
Now and then, yes.

619
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,880
OK...

620
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,160
How did you get this? By looking.

621
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,960
Where? The killer must have
driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

622
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,840
He could only keep her case
by accident if it was in the car.

623
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,680
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention -

624
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,600
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

625
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,200
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

626
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,320
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

627
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,960
I checked every backstreet wide enough for
a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens,

628
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,520
'and anywhere you could dispose of a
bulky object without being observed.

629
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,800
'Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.'

630
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,000
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

631
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,320
It had to be pink, obviously.
Why didn't I think of that(?)

632
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,920
Because you're an idiot.

633
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,640
No, no, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

634
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,320
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

635
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,520
From the case? How could I?

636
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,320
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

637
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,800
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

638
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,320
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

639
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,680
Maybe she left it at home.

640
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,880
She has a string of lovers and she's careful
about it. She never leaves her phone at home.

641
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,520
Er...

642
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,320
Why did I just send that text?

643
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,720
Well, the question is
where is her phone NOW?

644
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,320
She could have lost it. Yes, or?

645
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,240
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

646
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,480
Maybe she...left it when she left her case.
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

647
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,920
Either way, the balance of probability
is the murderer has her phone.

648
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,480
Sorry...what are we doing
- did I just text a murderer? What good will that do?

649
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,800
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

650
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,600
A few hours after his last victim,

651
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,960
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

652
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,960
If somebody had just found that phone they'd
ignore a text like that, but the murderer...

653
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,680
would panic.

654
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,840
Have you talked to the police? Four
people are dead, there isn't time.

655
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,600
So why are you talking to ME?

656
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,320
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

657
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,480
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

658
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,800
Relax, you're doing fine.

659
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,080
Well? Well, what? Well - you could
just sit there and...watch telly.

660
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,760
What, you want me to come with you? I like company
when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud.

661
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,160
The skull just
attracts attention, so...

662
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,600
Problem? Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

663
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,400
What about her?

664
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,480
She said...

665
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,760
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

666
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,320
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

667
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,440
Damn it!

668
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,840
Where are we going? Northumberland
Street's a five-minute walk from here.

669
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,400
You think he's stupid enough to go there? No
- I think he's brilliant enough.

670
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,360
I love the brilliant ones. They're
all so desperate to get caught.

671
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,640
Why? Appreciation!

672
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,320
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

673
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,000
That's the frailty of genius, John,
it needs an audience. Yeah.

674
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,320
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

675
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,720
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

676
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,680
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

677
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,720
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

678
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,000
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

679
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,360
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

680
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,720
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

681
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,800
Don't know. Who?

682
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

683
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,000
Thank you, Billy.

684
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,200
22 Northumberland Street.

685
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,440
Keep your eyes on it.

686
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,400
He's not just going to ring
the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

687
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,920
He HAS killed four people.

688
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,670
OK.

689
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,680
Sherlock!

690
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,240
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

691
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,480
On the house, for you
and for your date.

692
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,240
Do you want to eat? I'm not his date.

693
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,400
This man got me off a murder charge.

694
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,920
This is Angelo. Three years ago I proved to Lestrade
at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder

695
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,000
that Angelo was elsewhere,
house-breaking.

696
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,760
He cleared my name. I cleared it
a bit. Anything happening opposite?

697
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,920
Nothing.

698
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,760
But for this man, I'd have gone
to prison. You did go to prison.

699
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,440
I'll get a candle for the table.
It's more romantic.

700
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,960
I'm not his date!

701
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,840
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

702
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,360
Thanks.

703
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,480
People don't have arch-enemies.

704
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,480
I'm sorry? In real life.

705
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,880
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

706
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,280
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

707
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,280
So who did I meet?

708
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,120
What do real people have, then,
in their..."real lives"?

709
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,600
Friends?

710
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,800
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

711
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,720
Girlfriends, boyfriends.
Yes, well, as I was saying - dull.

712
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,320
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

713
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,360
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

714
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,110
Mm.

715
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,400
Oh, right.

716
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,000
Do you have a...boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

717
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,120
I know it's fine.

718
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,920
So you've got a boyfriend then. No.

719
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,800
Right. OK.

720
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,960
You're unattached. Like me.

721
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,760
Fine. Good.

722
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,640
John, erm...

723
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,360
I think you should know that
I consider myself married to my work,

724
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,720
and while I'm flattered,
I'm really not looking for any... No,

725
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,440
I'm...not asking. No.

726
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,400
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

727
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,840
TAXI OUTSIDE
Good.

728
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,760
Thank you.

729
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,840
Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

730
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,800
Nobody getting in,
and nobody getting out.

731
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,120
Why a taxi?

732
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,800
Oh, that's clever. Is it clever?
Why is it clever? That's him.

733
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,960
Don't stare.

734
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,000
You're staring. We can't both stare.

735
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,360
CAR HORN

736
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,960
Sorry...

737
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,760
I've got the cab number.
Good for you.

738
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,600
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane,

739
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,960
pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

740
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,360
Sorry.

741
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,480
TYRES SQUEAL

742
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,000
Come on, John...

743
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,920
Come on, John. We're losing him!

744
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,440
This way.

745
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,680
No - THIS way!

746
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,440
Sorry...

747
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,320
Police! Open her up.

748
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,600
SHERLOCK PANTS
No...

749
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,800
Teeth, tan. What - Californian...?

750
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,600
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

751
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,480
How could you possibly know that?
The luggage.

752
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,920
Probably your first trip
to London, right?

753
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,360
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

754
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,400
Sorry - are you guys the police?

755
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,800
Yeah. Everything all right?

756
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,680
Yeah.

757
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,760
Welcome to London.

758
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,800
Er, any problems - just let us know.

759
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Basically just a cab that
happened to slow down. Basically.

760
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,120
Not the murderer.
Not the murderer, no.

761
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,160
Wrong country, good alibi.

762
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,320
As they go.
Hey, where did you get this?

763
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,520
Detective Inspector Lestrade? Yeah.

764
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,400
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

765
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,920
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

766
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,720
What?
Nothing, just..."Welcome to London".

767
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,800
HE SNIGGERS

768
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,320
Got your breath back?
Ready when you are.

769
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,440
JOHN PANTS
OK...

770
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,240
That was ridiculous.

771
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,760
That was the most
ridiculous thing...I've ever done.

772
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,120
And you invaded Afghanistan.
THEY LAUGH

773
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,000
That wasn't just me.

774
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,680
Why aren't we back
at the restaurant?

775
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,880
They can keep an eye out.

776
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,880
It was a long shot anyway.

777
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,800
So what were we doing there?

778
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,360
Oh, just passing the time.

779
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,160
And proving a point.

780
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,720
What point? You.

781
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,760
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson
WILL take the room upstairs.

782
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,240
Says who?

783
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,800
Says the man at the door.

784
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,160
KNOCKING

785
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,720
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.

786
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,160
Ah...

787
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,880
Er, thank you.

788
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,120
Thank you.

789
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,160
Sherlock, what have you done?

790
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,280
Mrs Hudson? Upstairs.

791
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,240
What are you doing? Well, I knew
you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

792
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,400
You can't just break into my flat. You can't withhold evidence
- and I didn't break in.

793
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,800
Well, what do you call this then?

794
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,440
It's a drugs bust.
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

795
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,520
Have you met him? John...

796
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,800
You could search this flat all day, you wouldn't
find anything you could call recreational.

797
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,000
John, you probably want to
shut up now. But come on...

798
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,720
No... What?

799
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,760
You?
Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.

800
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,960
No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

801
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,800
Anderson, what are YOU doing here
on a drugs bust?

802
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,600
Oh, I volunteered. They all did. They're not strictly
speaking ON the drug squad, but they're very keen.

803
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,520
Are these human eyes?
Put those back!

804
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,960
They were in the microwave.
It's an experiment.

805
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,400
Keep looking, guys.

806
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,720
Or you could help us properly
and I'll stand them down.

807
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,880
This is childish.
Well, I'm dealing with a child.

808
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,920
Sherlock, this is our case. I'm letting
you in, but you do not go off on your own.

809
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,000
Clear? What - so you set up
a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

810
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,400
It stops being pretend
if we find anything. I am clean!

811
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,280
Is your flat...? All of it?

812
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,880
Don't even smoke.

813
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,120
Neither do I.

814
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,280
So let's work together.

815
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,000
We've found Rachel. Who is she?

816
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,680
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

817
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,640
Her daughter?

818
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,200
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

819
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,640
Never mind that, we found the case.

820
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,400
According to SOMEONE the murderer has the case, and
we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.

821
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,640
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Do your research.

822
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,320
You need to bring Rachel in
and I need to question her.

823
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,320
She's dead. Excellent. How, when and why?
Is there a connection? There has to be.

824
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,440
Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for
14 years. Technically she was never alive.

825
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,600
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

826
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,920
No, that's...

827
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,800
..that's not right. How...

828
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,760
Why would she do that? Why?

829
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,880
Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments? Yup
- sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

830
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,920
She didn't think about her daughter.

831
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,680
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

832
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,440
It took effort, it would have hurt.

833
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,960
You said that the victims all took the poison
themselves, that he MAKES them take it -

834
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,080
well, maybe he...I don't know, talks to them.
Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.

835
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,360
Yeah, but that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

836
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
Not good?

837
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,680
Bit not good, yeah.

838
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,000
If you were dying... If you'd been murdered
- in your very last few seconds what would you say?

839
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,880
"Please, God, let me live."
Use your imagination!

840
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,400
I don't have to.

841
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,920
Yeah, but if you were clever... Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers
- she WAS clever.

842
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,800
She's trying to tell us something.

843
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,440
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

844
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,960
I didn't order a taxi. Go away. Oh, dear. They're
making such a mess. What are they looking for?

845
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,720
It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

846
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,800
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

847
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,920
Shut up, everybody! Don't speak,
don't breathe. I'm trying to think.

848
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,240
Anderson, face the other way.
You're putting me off.

849
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,800
What? My FACE is(?)
Everybody quiet and still.

850
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,080
Anderson, turn your back.
Oh, for God's sake!

851
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,760
Your back, now, please!

852
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
Come on, think. Quick!
What about your taxi?

853
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,960
MRS HUDSON!

854
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,400
Oh...

855
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,150
Ah!

856
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,240
She was clever. Clever, yes!

857
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,680
She's cleverer than you lot and she's
dead. Do you see, do you get it?

858
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,280
She didn't lose her phone, she
never lost it. She PLANTED it on him.

859
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,320
When she got out of the car, she
knew that she was going to her death.

860
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:00,400
She left the phone in order to
lead us to her killer. But how?

861
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,320
What do you mean, how?

862
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,880
Rachel!

863
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,800
Don't you see? Rachel!

864
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,920
Oh...

865
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,640
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

866
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,400
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

867
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,600
Rachel is not a name.

868
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,440
Then what is it? John -
on the luggage, there's a label.

869
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,520
E-mail address.

870
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,720
She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her
business on her phone. A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

871
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,320
So there was a website
for her account.

872
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,480
The username is her e-mail address -
and all together, the password is?

873
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,800
Rachel.
So we can read her e-mails. So what?

874
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,800
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

875
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,600
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

876
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,360
Which means if you lose it you can locate it online.
She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.

877
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,480
Unless he got rid of it.
We know he didn't.

878
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,000
Come on, come on. Quickly!
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

879
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,720
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

880
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,800
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. This
phone battery won't last for ever.

881
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,920
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name. It's a start!

882
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,440
Sherlock... Narrows it down
from just anyone in London.

883
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,920
It's the first proper lead
that we've had. Sherlock...

884
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,360
Where is it? Quickly, where?

885
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,360
Here. It's...in 221 Baker Street.

886
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,240
How can it be here?

887
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,640
How?

888
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,160
Maybe it was in the case when you brought
it back and it...fell out somewhere.

889
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,760
What, and I didn't notice it?
Me - I didn't notice?

890
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,520
Anyway, we texted him
and he called back.

891
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,600
Guys, we're also looking
for a mobile somewhere here,

892
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,720
belonged to the victim... 'Who do we
trust, even if we don't know them?

893
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,440
'Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

894
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,440
'Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?'

895
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,280
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

896
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,440
Sherlock, you OK? What...?

897
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,720
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

898
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,680
So, how can the phone be here?

899
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,880
Don't know.

900
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,960
I'll try it again. Good idea.

901
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,680
Where are you going?

902
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,160
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

903
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,280
You sure you're all right? I'm fine.

904
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,160
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

905
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,640
I didn't order a taxi.

906
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,760
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

907
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,640
You're the cabbie.

908
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,520
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

909
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,800
It was you. Not your passenger.

910
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,920
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

911
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,920
It's like you're invisible.

912
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,760
Just the back of an 'ead.

913
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,400
Proper advantage
for a serial killer.

914
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,760
Is this a confession? Oh, yeah.

915
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,000
I'll tell you what else...

916
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,080
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

917
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,840
I'll sit quiet and they can
take me down, I promise.

918
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,200
Why?

919
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,160
Cos you're not going to do that.
Am I not?

920
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,960
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

921
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,160
I spoke to 'em...

922
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,240
and they killed themselves.

923
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,920
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

924
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,680
I will never tell you what I said.

925
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,440
No-one else will die, though, and
I believe they call that a result.

926
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,440
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

927
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,800
What kind of result
do you care about?

928
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,600
If I wanted to understand...

929
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,440
..what would I do?
Let me take you for a ride.

930
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,240
So you can kill me too?
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

931
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,360
I'm going to talk to ya...

932
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,000
..and then you're
going to kill yourself.

933
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,320
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

934
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,800
ENGINE STARTS

935
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,000
He just got in a cab... It's
Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab.

936
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,640
I told you, he does that.

937
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,160
He bloody left again.

938
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,840
We're wasting our time!

939
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,280
I'm...calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

940
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,160
PHONE RINGS

941
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,960
PHONE KEEPS RINGING

942
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,200
PHONE KEEPS RINGING

943
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,960
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

944
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,880
I'll try the search again.
Does it matter? Does any of it?

945
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:55,720
He's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you
down. And you're wasting your time. All our time.

946
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,200
OK, everybody...

947
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,720
done here.

948
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,800
How did you find me?

949
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,680
Oh, I recognised ya.

950
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,240
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

951
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,320
Sherlock Holmes!

952
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,800
I was warned about you.

953
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,720
I've been on your website, too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

954
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,320
Who warned you about me? Just
someone out there who's noticed.

955
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,520
Who?

956
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,360
Who would notice me?

957
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,600
You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
I'm really not.

958
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,840
Got yourself a fan.

959
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,520
Tell me more.

960
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,240
That's all you're going to know.

961
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,320
In THIS lifetime.

962
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,840
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

963
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,240
You know him better than I do.

964
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,440
I've known him for five years -
and no, I don't.

965
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,600
So why do you put up with him?

966
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,520
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

967
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,280
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man -

968
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,000
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

969
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,240
he might even be a good one.

970
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,600
Where are we?

971
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,920
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

972
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,920
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

973
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,880
Why here? It's open.

974
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,800
Cleaners are in.

975
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,960
One thing about being a cabbie
- you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder.

976
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,080
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

977
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And you just walk your victims in?
How?

978
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,680
Oh... Dull.

979
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,240
Don't worry. It gets better.

980
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,560
You can't make people take
their own lives at gunpoint. I don't.

981
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,360
It's much better than that.

982
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,440
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

983
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,920
BEEP

984
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,240
CONTINUED BEEPING

985
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,360
Well, what do you think?

986
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,560
It's up to you.

987
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,400
You're the one
who's going to die here.

988
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,360
No, I'm not.
That's what they all say.

989
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,120
Shall we talk?

990
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,360
Bit risky, wasn't it?

991
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,400
Took me away under the eye of
about half a dozen policemen.

992
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,720
They're not that stupid.

993
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,960
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

994
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,920
You call that a risk? Nah...

995
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,960
THIS is a risk.

996
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,320
Oh, I like this bit.

997
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,160
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

998
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,200
But you're about to.

999
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,880
I just have to do this...

1000
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,640
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

1001
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,360
Oh, you're going to love this.

1002
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,080
Love what?
Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

1003
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,560
Here in the flesh. That website
of yours, your fan told me about it.

1004
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,280
My fan?

1005
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,880
You are brilliant.

1006
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,280
You are a proper genius.

1007
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,280
The Science of Deduction.
Now, that...

1008
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,320
is proper thinking.

1009
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,520
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

1010
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,480
Don't it make you mad?

1011
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,280
Why can't people just think?

1012
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,640
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

1013
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,880
Don't look it, do I?

1014
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,960
Funny little man driving a cab.

1015
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,200
But you'll know better in a minute.

1016
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,200
Chances are it'll be
the last thing you EVER know.

1017
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,640
OK, two bottles. Explain.

1018
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,880
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

1019
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,440
You take the pill from
the good bottle, you live.

1020
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,600
You take the pill from
the bad bottle...you die.

1021
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,280
Both bottles are of course identical.
In every way.

1022
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,240
And you know which is which.
Of course I know. But I don't.

1023
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,080
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
You're the one who chooses.

1024
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,080
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

1025
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,880
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1026
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,080
Whatever bottle YOU choose,

1027
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,720
I take the pill from the other one.

1028
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,200
And then together...

1029
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,640
we take our medicine.

1030
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,720
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1031
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,160
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1032
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,440
Didn't expect that,
did you, Mr Holmes?

1033
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,040
This is what you did
to the rest of them -

1034
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,400
you gave them a choice?
And now I'm giving you one.

1035
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,000
You take your time.

1036
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,880
Get yourself together.

1037
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,840
I want your best game.
It's not a game, it's chance.

1038
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,520
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1039
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,400
It's not chance, Mr Holmes,
it's chess.

1040
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,040
It's a game of chess,

1041
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,680
with one move...and one survivor.

1042
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,520
And this - this...

1043
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,320
is the move.

1044
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,960
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

1045
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,200
You can choose either one.

1046
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,680
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -
I need to speak to him.

1047
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,440
It's important. It's an emergency.

1048
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,720
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1049
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,840
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1050
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,600
Ready to play? Play what?
It's a 50:50 chance.

1051
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,280
You're not playing the numbers,
you're playing ME.

1052
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,320
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

1053
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,440
Is it a bluff,

1054
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,520
or a double bluff?

1055
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,640
Or a triple bluff?
It's still just chance.

1056
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,640
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

1057
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,320
Luck. It's genius!

1058
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,520
I know how people think.

1059
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,480
I know how people think I think.

1060
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,960
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

1061
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,280
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1062
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,960
Or maybe God just loves me.

1063
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,160
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

1064
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,360
So...

1065
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,440
You risked your life four times
just to kill strangers? Why?

1066
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,040
Time to play.

1067
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,520
Oh, I am playing.

1068
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,720
This is my turn.

1069
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,280
There's shaving foam behind your left
ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1070
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,040
Traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own
- there's no-one to tell you.

1071
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,960
But there's a photograph of children.
Their mother's been cut out.

1072
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,640
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1073
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,600
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

1074
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,040
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

1075
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,320
Estranged father.

1076
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,280
She took the kids,

1077
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,680
but you still love them
and it still hurts.

1078
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,000
Ah, but there's more.

1079
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,040
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1080
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,720
but everything you're wearing
is at least...three years old?

1081
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,640
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

1082
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,640
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

1083
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,000
Ah...

1084
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,200
Three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

1085
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,520
Told me what?

1086
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,600
That you're a dead man walking.
So are you.

1087
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,280
You don't have long, though.

1088
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,360
Am I right?

1089
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,720
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1090
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,600
Any breath could be my last.

1091
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,120
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

1092
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,000
I've outlived four people.

1093
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,360
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

1094
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,120
No... No, there's something else.

1095
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,120
You didn't just kill four people because
you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic.

1096
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:05,120
Love
is a much more vicious motivator.

1097
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,720
Somehow, this is about your children.

1098
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,160
Oh...

1099
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,600
You ARE good, in't ya? But how?

1100
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,880
When I die they won't get much,
my kids.

1101
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,240
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1102
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,560
Or serial killing.
You'd be surprised.

1103
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,240
Surprise me.

1104
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,000
I have a sponsor.

1105
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,280
You have a what? For every life
I take, money goes to my kids.

1106
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,680
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

1107
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,760
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1108
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,720
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1109
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,360
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1110
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,760
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

1111
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,960
There's others out there just
like you, except you're just a man.

1112
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,520
And they're so much more than that.

1113
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,120
What do you mean...

1114
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,160
more than a man?

1115
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,280
An organisation...? What?

1116
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,480
There's a name, that no-one says.

1117
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,320
And I'm not going to say it either.

1118
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,120
Now, enough chatter.

1119
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,840
Time to choose.

1120
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,120
Sherlock?!

1121
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,280
Sherlock!

1122
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,680
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

1123
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,680
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1124
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,640
or I can shoot you in the head.

1125
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,640
Funnily enough,

1126
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,640
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1127
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,680
I'll have the gun, please.

1128
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,360
Are you sure?

1129
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,200
Definitely. The gun.

1130
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,240
You don't want to phone a friend(?)

1131
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,560
The gun.

1132
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,280
I know a real gun when I see one.

1133
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,440
None of the others did. Clearly.

1134
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,920
Well, this has been very interesting.

1135
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,360
I look forward to the court case.

1136
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,280
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

1137
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,840
Which one's the good bottle?

1138
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,000
Course. Child's play.

1139
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,280
Well, which one, then?

1140
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,240
Which one would you have picked?

1141
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,320
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

1142
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,400
Come on!

1143
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,240
Play the game.

1144
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,200
Oh!

1145
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,560
Interesting.

1146
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,360
So what do you think?

1147
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,400
Shall we?

1148
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,280
Really... What do you think?

1149
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,120
Can you beat me?

1150
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,360
Are you clever enough...

1151
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,280
..to bet your life?

1152
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,560
FAINTLY: SHERLOCK!

1153
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,920
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1154
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,840
I know you do.

1155
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,520
A man like you. So clever.

1156
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,960
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

1157
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,720
Still the addict.

1158
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,080
But this...this is what
you're really addicted to.

1159
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,440
You'll do anything...

1160
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,640
..anything at all,
to stop being bored.

1161
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,400
You're not bored now, are ya?

1162
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,720
Isn't it good?

1163
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,880
GUNSHOT

1164
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,680
CABBIE GASPS

1165
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,480
Was I right?

1166
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,320
I was, wasn't I?

1167
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,720
Did I get it right?!

1168
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,440
OK... Tell me this.

1169
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,320
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1170
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,360
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

1171
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,240
I want a name.

1172
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,720
No...

1173
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,880
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

1174
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,480
Give me...a name.

1175
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,240
HE GASPS

1176
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,000
A name! Now.

1177
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,280
The name!

1178
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,960
HE GASPS
MORIARTY!

1179
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,760
SIRENS WAIL

1180
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,560
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1181
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,320
Yeah, it's for shock.
I'm not in shock.

1182
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,000
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

1183
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,360
So, the shooter. No sign?

1184
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,480
Cleared off before we got here. But a guy
like that would have had enemies, I suppose.

1185
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,680
One of them could have
been following him, but...

1186
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,760
we've got nothing to go on.

1187
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,360
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1188
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,520
OK. Give me.

1189
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,520
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

1190
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:19,120
A kill shot over that distance, that's a crack
shot. But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1191
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,720
His hands couldn't have shaken at all
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1192
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,600
He didn't fire until I was in immediate
danger though, so strong moral principle.

1193
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,680
You're looking for a man probably with
a history of military service, and...

1194
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,000
nerves of steel...

1195
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:42,040
Actually, do you know what?
Ignore me. Sorry? Ignore all of that.

1196
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,720
It's just the er...the shock talking.

1197
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,600
Where are you going? I just
need to...talk about the rent.

1198
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,040
I've still got questions. What now? I'm in shock
- look, I've got a blanket.

1199
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:56,280
Sherlock! And, I just caught you
a serial killer... More or less.

1200
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,280
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow,
off you go.

1201
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,520
Erm - Sergeant Donovan has...
just been explaining everything.

1202
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,560
The two pills...

1203
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,560
Dreadful business, isn't it?
Dreadful.

1204
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,760
Good shot.

1205
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,080
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through
that window. Well, you'd know.

1206
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,520
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

1207
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,640
I don't suppose you'd serve time for
this, but let's avoid the court case.

1208
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,400
Are you all right?
Yes, of course I'm all right.

1209
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,120
Well, you have just killed a man.
Yes...

1210
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,200
That's true, isn't it?

1211
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,440
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1212
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,920
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

1213
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,880
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

1214
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,600
You should have seen
the route he took us to get here.

1215
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,320
Stop it! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1216
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,840
Well, you're the one who shot him.
Keep your voice down.

1217
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,360
Sorry, it's just erm...
nerves, I think. Sorry.

1218
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,680
You were going to take that damn
pill, weren't you? Course I wasn't.

1219
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,680
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

1220
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,320
No, you didn't.

1221
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:19,080
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it
- you risk your life to prove you're clever.

1222
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,040
Why would I do that?
Because you're an idiot.

1223
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,200
Dinner? Starving.

1224
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,960
End of Baker Street there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1225
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,480
You can tell a good Chinese by the
bottom third of the door handle.

1226
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,440
Sherlock... That's him, that's
the man I was talking to you about.

1227
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,080
I know exactly who that is.

1228
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,640
So... Another case cracked.

1229
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,200
How very public-spirited.

1230
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,480
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

1231
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,200
What are you doing here?

1232
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,720
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1233
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,160
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

1234
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,920
Always so aggressive.

1235
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,760
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

1236
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,880
Oddly enough - no.

1237
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,960
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

1238
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,080
This petty feud between us
is simply childish.

1239
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,840
People will suffer. And you know
how it always upset Mummy.

1240
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,600
I upset her?

1241
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,350
Me?

1242
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,320
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1243
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,680
No. No, wait...

1244
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,120
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1245
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,520
Mother. Our mother.

1246
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,240
This is my brother, Mycroft.

1247
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,200
Putting on weight again?

1248
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:28,600
Losing it, in fact.
He's your brother?

1249
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,480
Course he's my brother.

1250
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,080
So he's not... Not what?

1251
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,000
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

1252
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,320
Close enough. For goodness' sake.

1253
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,600
I occupy a minor position
in the British government.

1254
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:47,480
He IS the British government, when he's not
too busy being the British secret service

1255
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,160
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1256
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:52,720
Good evening, Mycroft. Try not
to start a war before I get home,

1257
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,360
you know what it does
for the traffic.

1258
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,640
So, when you say you're concerned about him
- you actually are concerned?

1259
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,200
Yes, of course.

1260
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,320
I mean, it actually is
a childish feud?

1261
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,280
He's always been so resentful.

1262
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,920
You can imagine
the Christmas dinners. Yeah...

1263
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,960
No... God, no.

1264
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,880
I'd better erm...

1265
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,040
Hello again.

1266
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,280
Hello.
We met earlier on this evening.

1267
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,320
Oh! OK. Goodnight.

1268
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,960
Goodnight, Dr Watson.

1269
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,520
So, dim sum. Mmm!

1270
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,080
I can always predict
the fortune cookies. No, you can't.

1271
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,120
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

1272
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,440
Sorry? In Afghanistan.
There was an actual wound.

1273
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,880
Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
Shoulder! I thought so.

1274
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,200
No, you didn't. The left one.
Lucky guess. I never guess.

1275
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,720
Yes, you do.

1276
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,360
What are you so happy about?
Moriarty.

1277
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,520
What's Moriarty?
I've absolutely no idea.

1278
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,840
Sir, shall we go?

1279
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,600
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1280
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,360
He could be the making
of my brother...

1281
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,040
or make him worse than ever.

1282
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:06,040
Either way, we'd better
upgrade their surveillance status.

1283
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,400
Grade three active.

1284
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,400
Sorry, sir - whose status?

1285
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,760
Sherlock Holmes, and Dr Watson.
