```It appears that the text you provided is a bit fragmented and contains some characters that are not part of the actual content. I will clean it up and analyze the meaningful part of the text. Here is the cleaned version:

```
Uruk-hai.
Who do you serve?
Saruman!
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.
You will taste man-flesh!
Ben of the halflings carries
something of great value.
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.
Kill the others.
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.
May these cloaks shield you
from unfriendly eyes.
Lembas.
Elvish waybread.
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.
How many did you

### Reconstructed Text:
```
. . . dark places. . . when all other lights go out.
I have taken my worst wound at this parting. . . having looked my last upon that which is fairest.
Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.
What was her gift?
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.
She gave me three.
Gollum.
He has tracked us since Moria.
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.
But he's too clever a waterman.
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts..
. . . it will make the crossing..
