I think of that (?)
Because you're an idiot.
No, no, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?
From the case, how could I?
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.
We know she had one.
You just texted it.
Maybe she left it at home.
She has a string of lovers and she's careful
about it. She never leaves her phone at home.
Er...
Why did I just send that text?
Well, the question is
where is her?
