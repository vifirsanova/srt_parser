1
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:52,177
Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,967
But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort,

3
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:01,147
which could only be broken
by Love's first kiss.

4
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,797
She was locked away in a castle
guarded by a terrible...

5
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:07,760
...fire breathing dragon.

6
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,882
Many brave knights had
attempted to free her from...

7
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:15,142
...this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.

8
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,776
She waited in the dragon's
keep in the highest...

9
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:22,191
...room of the tallest
tower for her true love...

10
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:26,253
...and true love's first kiss.

11
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,864
Like that's ever going to happen.

12
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:33,552
What a loony.

13
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:56,658
Shrek

14
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,752
Beware

15
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,903
Stay out

16
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,702
I think he's in here.

17
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,995
All right. Lets get it.

18
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,998
Hold on. Do you know what
that thing can do to you?

19
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,394
Yeah. He'll groan into
your bones for his brains.

20
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,981
Well actually that would be a giant.

21
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,291
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.

22
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,734
They'll make a soup from
your freshly peeled skin.

23
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,726
They'll chew your livers,
squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

24
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,436
Actually, it's quite good on toast.

25
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,788
Back, back beast, back.

26
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,335
I warned you.

27
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:16,798
Right.

28
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,774
This is the part, where you run away.

29
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah.

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,868
And stay out.

31
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:51,250
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.

32
00:04:54,586 --> 00:05:00,342
Right, this one is full. Take it away.

33
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,288
Give me that.

34
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,249
Your fine days are over.
- 25 pieces of silver for the witch.

35
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,396
Next.
- Come on.

36
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,567
Sit down there. And be quiet.

37
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,986
This cage is so small.

38
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,638
You wouldn't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.

39
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,182
Please, give me another chance.

40
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,282
Oh, shut up.

41
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,226
Next.

42
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:26,977
What do we got?

43
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,771
This little wooden puppet.

44
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:34,042
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.

45
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,570
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.

46
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,614
No. Please, don't let them do it.

47
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,240
Next. What do you got?

48
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,385
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

49
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,620
Right.

50
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,873
Well that's good for ten schillings,
if you can prove it.

51
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:52,519
Oh, go ahead fella.

52
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,046
Well?

53
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,548
He's just a li..., just a little nervous.

54
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,283
He's really quite a chatterbox.

55
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,552
You boneheaded donkey.

56
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,012
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards.

57
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,907
No, no, he talks, he does.

58
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,618
I can talk. I love to talk.

59
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,413
I've talked to...

60
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:17,544
Get her out of my sight.
- No, no, I swear.

61
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,034
Hey, I can fly.
- He can fly. -He can fly.

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,854
He can talk.
- That's right, fool.

63
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,817
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

64
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,000
You might have seen house fly,
maybe even a superfly.

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,941
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly.

66
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,156
Seize him.

67
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:02,589
Get him. This way. Hurry.

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,804
You there. Ogre.
- I.

69
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,748
By the order of lord Farquaad.

70
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,333
I am authorized to place you
both under arrest.

71
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:19,439
And transport you to designated
resettlement facility.

72
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,300
Oh really?

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,238
You and what army?

74
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,398
Can I say something to you?

75
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,902
Listen, you were really, really something,
back there. Incredible.

76
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,963
Are you talking to...

77
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,382
...me?

78
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,992
Yes, I was talking to you.

79
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,695
Can I just tell you that you were
really great back there with those guards.

80
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:50,871
They thought that was all over there.

81
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,053
And then you showed up and bam!
There was tripping...

82
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,833
...on over themselves
like babes in the woods.

83
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,443
That really made me feel good to see that.

84
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,920
Oh, that's great. Really.

85
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,213
Man, it's good to be free.

86
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,229
Now, why don't you go
celebrate your freedom...

87
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,454
...with your own friends?

88
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,054
But I...

89
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,639
I don't have any friends.

90
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,266
And I'm not going out there by myself.

91
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,768
Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea...

92
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,228
I'll stick with you.

93
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,604
You and me in green fighting machine.

94
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:21,110
Together we'll scare the
spin if anybody crosses us.

95
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,088
Oh, a, that was really scary.

96
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,929
Maybe you don't mine me
saying. If that don't work,

97
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,684
your breath will certainly
do the job done, 'cause...

98
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:31,161
...you definitively need
some tic-tac or something,

99
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,722
'cause your breath stinks.

100
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,624
Man you've? my note.

101
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,268
Just like the time...

102
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,003
...and then I ate some rotten berries.

103
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,339
Man I had some strong gases leaking
out of my but that day.

104
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,026
Why are you following me?

105
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,446
I'll tell you why.

106
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,696
'Cause I'm all alone,

107
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,786
there is no one here, beside me.

108
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:03,001
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.

109
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:08,006
But you got to have free...
- Stop singing.

110
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,951
Well, it's no wonder, you
don't have any friends.

111
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,604
Wow. Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

112
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:15,372
Listen. Little donkey.

113
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,434
Take a look at me. What am I?

114
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,771
A...

115
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:23,839
...really tall?

116
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:29,278
No. I'm an Ogre.
You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.

117
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,573
Doesn't that bother you?

118
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,641
Nope.

119
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,785
Really?
- Really really.

120
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:37,978
Oh?

121
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,230
Man, I like you. What's your name?

122
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,500
A... Shrek.

123
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,319
Shrek?

124
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,528
But do you know, what I
like about you, Shrek?

125
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,573
You've got that kind of:

126
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,531
'I don't care what nobody
thinks of me' thing.

127
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:54,970
I like that, I respect that,
Shrek. You're all right.

128
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,997
Uh, look at that.

129
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,291
Who would wanna live in a place like that?

130
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,602
That would be my home.

131
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:06,757
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.

132
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,426
It's amazing what you did
with such a modest budget.

133
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:15,741
I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

134
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,604
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?

135
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,704
I like my privacy.

136
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,983
You know I do to.
That's another thing, we have in common.

137
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,668
Like I hate it when you
got somebody in your face.

138
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,320
You try to give them a
hint and they won't leave.

139
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,842
And then there's that big occurred silence,
you know?

140
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,221
Can I stay with you?
- What?

141
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,851
Can I stay with you, please.

142
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,184
Of course.
- Really?

143
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,920
No.
- Please. I don't want to go back there.

144
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,297
You don't how is like to
be concerned like a freak.

145
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,092
Well..., maybe you do.
But that's why we have to stick together.

146
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,428
You got to let me stay. Please. Please.

147
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,613
OK, OK.

148
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,349
But one night only.
- Huh, thank you.

149
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,767
A, what are you do... No.

150
00:10:58,867 --> 00:10:59,783
This is going to be fun.

151
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,603
We can stay up late,
swap the manly stories.

152
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,980
And in the morning...

153
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,999
I'm making waffles.

154
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
Where do I sleep?

155
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,754
Outside.

156
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,867
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...

157
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,470
...so I guess, outside is best for me.

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,016
Here I go.

159
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,145
Good night.

160
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,216
I do like that half door.
I'm a donkey all alone outside.

161
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:36,272
Sit by myself outside, I guess.

162
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:44,454
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.

163
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:52,564
I thought, I told you to stay outside.
- I am outside.

164
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,639
Well James. This is far from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

165
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,076
It's not...

166
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,621
What a lovely bed.
- Got you.

167
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,292
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.

168
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,737
Is that you Gordon?
- How did you know?

169
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:20,876
Enough. What are you doing in my house?

170
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,037
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table.

171
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:29,560
Where would we supposed to put her.
The bed's taken.

172
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,628
What?

173
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:36,900
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs.
I'm a terrifying Ogre.

174
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:43,282
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?

175
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:50,747
Oh, no. No, no.

176
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:04,678
What are you doing in my swamp?

177
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,420
All right, get out of here. All of you.
Move it. Come on, let's go.

178
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,023
And hurry up, hurry up.

179
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:22,154
No, no, not there. Not there.

180
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,974
Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

181
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,879
Oh gosh, no one invited us.
- What?

182
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,480
We were forced to come here.
- By who?

183
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,043
Lord Farquaad. He?

184
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,988
All right.

185
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:45,302
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

186
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,704
Oh I do. I know where he is.

187
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:52,809
Does anyone else know
where to find him?

188
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,604
Anyone at all? -Me. -Anyone?

189
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,650
Oh pick me, I know. Me, me.

190
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,236
Ok, fine.

191
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:07,366
Attention all fairy tale things.

192
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,562
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially warned up.

193
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:16,909
In fact. I'm gonna see this
guy Farquaad right now...

194
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:22,256
...and get all off my land
and back where you came from.

195
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:32,057
You. You're coming with me.

196
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,625
All right. That's what I like to hear, man.

197
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,003
Shrek and Donkey, two
stubborn friends off on a...

198
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,715
...world and big city adventure. I love it.

199
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:45,195
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek.
I'm on road again...

200
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,723
What did I say about singing?

201
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:48,849
Can I whistle?
- No.

202
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,037
Well, can I hummer?
- All right.

203
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:27,529
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

204
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,568
Run, run, run as fast as you can,
you can't catch me.

205
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,837
I'm the gingerbread man.

206
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,447
You monster.

207
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,282
I'm not a monster here. You are.

208
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:52,037
You and the rest of that fairytale trash,
poisoning my perfect world.

209
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:56,391
Now tell me. Where are the others?
- Eat me.

210
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:01,338
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end.

211
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,299
Tell me. Or I'll...
- No, no, not the buttons.

212
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,260
Not gumdrop buttons.

213
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,429
All right. Who's hiding them?

214
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,781
Ok, I'll tell you.

215
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,226
Do you know the muffin-man?
- The muffin-man?

216
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,981
The muffin-man.
- Yes, I know the muffin-man.

217
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,857
Who lives on Proully lane?

218
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,569
Well, she's married to the muffin-man.
- The muffin-man.

219
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,840
The muffin-man.
- She's married to the muffin-man.

220
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,090
My lord. We found it.

221
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,889
Well then, what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

222
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,470
Magic mirror.

223
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,616
Don't tell him anything.

224
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,742
Evening.

225
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,698
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

226
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:03,233
Is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

227
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,478
Well, technically, you're not a king.

228
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,089
A..., felonious.

229
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,283
You were saying.
- What I mean is a...

230
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,743
...you're not a king, yet.

231
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:17,748
But you can become one.
All you have to do, is marry a princess.

232
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,848
Go on.

233
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,077
So, just sit back and relax my lord,

234
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:28,217
because it's time for you
to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

235
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,320
And here they are.

236
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,055
Bachelorette number one
is a mentally abused...

237
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,100
...shading from a kingdom far, far away.

238
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,769
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.

239
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,231
Her hobbies include cooking and
cleaning for two evil sisters.

240
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,250
Please welcome... Cinderella.

241
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,654
Bachelorette number two is a
kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.

242
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,740
Although she lives with seven other man,
she is not easy.

243
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,452
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips
and find out what a live wife she is.

244
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,389
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.

245
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,708
And last but certainly not least.

246
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,627
Bachelorette number three is a
fire-breathing?,

247
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,835
dragon guarded castle,
surrounded by a hot...

248
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,090
...boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.

249
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,010
She's a loaded pistol who likes
Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain.

250
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,198
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.

251
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,727
So will it be, bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two?

252
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,105
Or bachelorette number three?

253
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,625
Two... -Three. -Two.

254
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,694
One. No, no, no.

255
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,029
Three. Pick number three my lord.

256
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,966
Ok, ok. Number three.

257
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:42,516
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen...
princess Fiona.

258
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:48,564
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.

259
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,008
All I have to do is just find someone...

260
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,844
But I probably should mention little thing
that happens at night...

261
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,596
I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset...

262
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,347
Silence.

263
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,808
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.

264
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,996
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king.

265
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,607
Captain. Assemble your finest man.

266
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:12,337
We're going to have a tournament.

267
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,491
That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc.

268
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,159
I've told you I'll find it.

269
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,930
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.

270
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,181
Aha, that's the place.

271
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:29,688
Do you think maybe he's
compensating for something.

272
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:36,528
Hey, hey wait up Shrek.

273
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,532
Hey, you.
- No, no.

274
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,601
Wait a second.

275
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:48,540
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...

276
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,116
It's quiet.

277
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,538
Too quiet.

278
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,457
Where is everybody?

279
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:35,212
Hey look at this.

280
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,717
Wow.

281
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:27,514
Let's do that again.
- No. no.

282
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:38,282
All right.

283
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:40,052
You're going the right
way for smack bottom.

284
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,404
Sorry about that.

285
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,808
That champion should have
the honor, no, no...

286
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:50,577
...the privilege to go forth
and rescue the lovely...

287
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:55,267
...princess Fiona from the
fireing keep of the dragon.

288
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:59,209
If for any reason the
winner is unsuccessful,

289
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:02,709
the first runner up will take his place.

290
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,219
And so on, and so forth.

291
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:14,061
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

292
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,311
Applause.

293
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:22,110
Let the tournament begin.

294
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,324
What is that?

295
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,143
Ugh, it's hideous.

296
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,120
Oh, that's not very nice.

297
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,581
It's just a donkey.

298
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,275
Indeed.

299
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,842
Knights. New plan. The
one, who kills the Ogre,

300
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,613
will be named champion.

301
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,713
How about him.

302
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:49,012
Oh, hey. Now, come on.

303
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:53,767
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

304
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,502
No?

305
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,438
All right then.

306
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:02,985
Come on.

307
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,894
Hey Shrek. Let me, let me.

308
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:51,033
The chair. Give him the chair.

309
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,207
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

310
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:19,478
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel.

311
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,135
Shall I give the order sir?

312
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,780
No. I have a better idea.

313
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,910
People of Duloc. I give you our champion.

314
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
What?

315
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,329
Congratulation, Ogre.

316
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:43,235
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

317
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,963
Quest? I'm already on a quest.

318
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,990
A quest to get my swamp back.

319
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,968
Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp.

320
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,873
Where you dumped those
fairytale creatures.

321
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,165
Indeed.

322
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,417
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.

323
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,921
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.

324
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,315
Exactly the way it was?

325
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,968
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.

326
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:12,364
And the squatters?
- As good as gone.

327
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,954
What kind of quest?

328
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:19,897
Ok, let me get this straight.

329
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,200
We gonna go find the dragon
and rescue a princess...

330
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,243
...just so Farquaad will
give you back the swamp,

331
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,649
which you only don't have,
'cause he filled it...

332
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:26,779
...with full of freaks on the first place.

333
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,572
Is that about right?
- You know what?

334
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,742
Maybe there is a good reason,
donkeys shouldn't talk.

335
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,842
I don't get it Shrek.

336
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,870
Why didn't you just pull
some old Ogre stuff on them?

337
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,042
You know... Grab his
bones to make you brave.

338
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:40,084
You know the whole Ogre trick.

339
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:43,401
Oh, you know what. Maybe I
could have decapitated...

340
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,215
...entire village and put their heads on plate.

341
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:50,602
Got a knife, cut open their spleens
and drink their fluids.

342
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:53,572
Does that sound good to you?

343
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,432
A, no, not really, no.

344
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:56,597
For your information,

345
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,144
there is a lot more to
Ogres than people think.

346
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,622
Example.
- Example?

347
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:06,168
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.

348
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,071
They stink?
- Yes, no.

349
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,489
O, they make you cry.
- No.

350
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,007
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and...

351
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,892
...they get all brown and
start? little wild hairs?

352
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:18,263
No. Layers. Onions have layers.

353
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,667
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.

354
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:26,063
You get it? We both have layers.

355
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:30,651
O, you both have layers.

356
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,137
You know not everybody likes onions.

357
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:36,181
Cake. Everybody loves
cakes. Cakes have layers.

358
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,868
I don't care what everyone likes.

359
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:44,414
Ogres are not like cakes.

360
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,068
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.

361
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,946
Have you ever met a person and you say:
'Hey, let's get some paffe' and...

362
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,282
...they say I don't like
paffe. Paffe is delicious.

363
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:57,649
No. You tensed, irritating,
miniature peace of barden.

364
00:27:57,749 --> 00:28:00,664
Ogres are like onions. End of story.

365
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:05,060
Bye, bye. See you lather.

366
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:11,592
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

367
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,344
You know I think I've
preferred your humming.

368
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,930
Do you have a tissue or something,
'cause I'm making a mess.

369
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,326
Just the word paffe has
made me start slimying

370
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,934
Why, Shrek, did you do that?

371
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,520
Man you got to warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

372
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,813
My mouth was opened and everything.

373
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:10,209
Believe me donkey, if it
was me, you'd be dead.

374
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,904
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

375
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:16,381
Yeah, right, brimstone.

376
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,785
Don't be talking? brimstone.
I know what I smell and? no brimstone.

377
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:24,181
And they don't come of stone neither.

378
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:44,159
Sure it's big enough,
but look at the location.

379
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:52,075
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said
that Ogres have layers?

380
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:54,503
Oh, yeah.

381
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:58,073
Well, I have a confession to make.
Donkeys don't have layers.

382
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,259
We wear? sleeves.

383
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,786
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

384
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:07,458
You know what I mean.
- Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.

385
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,804
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being
on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava.

386
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:15,814
Come on donkey, I'm right
here beside you. Ok?

387
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:18,402
For emotional support.

388
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:23,223
We'll just hackle this thing together
one little baby step after time.

389
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,184
Really?
- Really really.

390
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,352
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.

391
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,597
Just keep moving and don't look down.

392
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:34,960
Don't look down, don't look down.

393
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,675
Shrek. I'm looking down.

394
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,577
I can't do this. Just let
me off right now, please.

395
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,039
But you're already half way.
- Yeah, but I know that half is safe.

396
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:50,000
Ok, fine. I don't have time
for this. You go back.

397
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,396
Shrek, no, wait.

398
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,757
Don't do that.

399
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,860
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

400
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,864
Oh. This?
- Yes, that.

401
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:07,451
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.

402
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:11,997
No, Shrek.
- I'm doing it.

403
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:16,457
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna
die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

404
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:23,133
That will do Donkey, that will do.

405
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,639
Cool.

406
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,316
So where is this fire breathing
pain in the neck anyway?

407
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:35,145
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.

408
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:39,691
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.

409
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:59,253
Are you afraid?
- No, but shhhhh.

410
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:04,174
Oh, good. Me neither.

411
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,749
Because there's nothing
wrong with being afraid.

412
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:09,371
Here's a..., something
responsible of the situation.

413
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:14,418
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.

414
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,198
I'm sure he's meaner
than a cow or anything,

415
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:17,821
but they're scare. You know what I mean.

416
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:22,192
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...

417
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,737
Donkey. Two things. Ok?

418
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:28,323
Shut, up.

419
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:31,059
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

420
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,395
Stairs? I thought we were
looking for the princess.

421
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:38,525
The princess will be up the stairs in the
highest room in the tallest tower.

422
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,319
What makes you think she'll be there?

423
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,754
I read it in a book once.

424
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:46,950
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.

425
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,703
Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll... That's right.

426
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:54,099
Those stairs won't know
which way they go.

427
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,810
The drafting stairs,?

428
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,965
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master.
I'm master of the stairs.

429
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:06,010
I wish I had a stair
right here right here now,

430
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,110
I'd step all over it.

431
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,225
Well, at least we know
where the princess is.

432
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:15,621
But where is the...
- Dragon.

433
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,306
Donkey, look out.

434
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,570
Got you.

435
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,860
Oh, what large teeth you have.

436
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,660
I mean, white sparkling teeth.

437
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,806
You probably hear this all the
time from your food, but...

438
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,187
...you must bleach yourself,

439
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:36,518
because that is one dashing
smile you got there.

440
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,480
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?

441
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,249
And you know what else?

442
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:48,194
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure.
I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,

443
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:53,174
'cause you're just ricking
the feminine beauty out.

444
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,040
What's the matter with you?
Do you have something in your eye?

445
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,293
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know
I'm a asthmatic and

446
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:04,505
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.

447
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:08,609
Shrek.

448
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,155
No, Shrek. Shrek.

449
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:46,880
Wake up.
- What?

450
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,274
Are you princess Fiona?

451
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,525
I am.

452
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,221
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

453
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,473
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.

454
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,573
But wait, sir knight.

455
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,853
This be our first meeting.

456
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:04,438
Should not be wonderful,
romantic moment?

457
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,793
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.

458
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,113
Hey, what are you doing?

459
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,263
You know, you should
sweep me out of my feet.

460
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:15,242
Out through the window and down
the rope by to your valued steed.

461
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,453
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

462
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:21,841
Uh-um.

463
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:24,668
But we have to sing through this moment.

464
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,573
You can residing of a poem to me.

465
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:31,900
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.

466
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,802
I don't think so.

467
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:38,198
Well, can I at least know
a name of my champion?

468
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:41,018
Shrek.

469
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,662
So, Shrek.

470
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:48,842
I pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

471
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:54,298
Thanks.

472
00:36:55,591 --> 00:37:00,120
You didn't slay the dragon?
- It's not my job to do this. Now, come on.

473
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,516
But this isn't right.?

474
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,002
That's what all the other knights did.

475
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:10,130
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.

476
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,983
That's not the point.

477
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,719
Wait. Where are you going?
Exit is over there.

478
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,363
Well, I have to save my ass.

479
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,491
What kind of knight are you?

480
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:26,038
One of a kind.

481
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:37,032
...rush into a physical relationship.

482
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:41,453
I'm not that emotionally ready
for commitment of a this magnitude.

483
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,164
That was the word I was
looking for. Magnitude.

484
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,792
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

485
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,710
Hey, what are you doing?

486
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,214
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and
take this one step at the time.

487
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:53,762
I mean, we really should get
to know each other first,

488
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:54,533
you know what am I saying.

489
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:58,904
As friends, maybe even as?

490
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,561
Hey don't do that. That's my tail.
That's ma personal tail.

491
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:09,957
And you're going to tear it off...

492
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:17,339
Oh, no. No.

493
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:48,752
It talks?
- Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.

494
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:28,327
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.

495
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:32,831
I'll take care of the dragon.

496
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:41,089
Ruuuuun.

497
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,764
You did it. You rescued me.

498
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,226
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a...

499
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,380
...a little unorthodox I admit, but...

500
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,776
...by deed is great and by heart is pure.
I'm entirely in your debt.

501
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:51,047
And where would a brave knight
be without his noble steed.

502
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:54,062
I hope you heard that. She
called me a noble steed.

503
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,623
She thinks I'm a steed.

504
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,173
The battle is won.

505
00:40:58,273 --> 00:41:01,445
You may remove your
helmet good sir knight.

506
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:04,923
Aah, no.
- Why not?

507
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,617
I have helmet hair.

508
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:09,653
Please. I wouldst look upon
the face of my rescuer.

509
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:12,306
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.

510
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,850
But, how will you kiss me?

511
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,396
What? That wasn't in a job description.

512
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:23,025
Maybe it's a perk?
- No. It's destiny.

513
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:25,819
You must know how it goes.

514
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:32,518
A princess locked in a tower and besieged
by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.

515
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:36,413
And then they share true love's first kiss.

516
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,213
With Shrek? You think, wait...

517
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,652
...you think Shrek is your true love?

518
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:46,048
Well, yes.

519
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,035
You think that Shrek is your true love.

520
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,135
What is so funny?

521
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,998
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?

522
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,644
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

523
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:01,004
Now, now remove your helmet.

524
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,365
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

525
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,467
Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

526
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,677
Take it off.
- No.

527
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:10,531
Now.
- Ok, easy.

528
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:15,077
As you command your highness.

529
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:28,048
You're an Ogre.

530
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,076
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

531
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:35,472
Well, yes, actually.

532
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:41,323
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're
not supposed to be an Ogre.

533
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:46,633
Princess, I was sent to rescue
you by lord Farquaad, ok?

534
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,594
He's the one, who wants to marry you.

535
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,096
Well, then why didn't
he come to rescue me?

536
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,196
Good question.

537
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:54,641
You should ask him
that, when we get there.

538
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,895
But I have to be rescued by my true love.

539
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:00,831
Not by some Ogre and his pet.

540
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,900
Well so much for noble steed.

541
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,511
Look princess. You're not
making my job any easier.

542
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:09,031
Well I'm sorry, but your
job is not my problem.

543
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:14,469
You can tell lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly.

544
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:16,914
I'll be waiting for him right here.

545
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,584
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?

546
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:25,022
I'm a delivery boy.
- You wouldn't dare.

547
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:26,965
You coming donkey?
- Put me down.

548
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:28,842
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

549
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:32,096
Put me down or you will
suffer the consequences.

550
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:36,533
This is not dignified. Put me down.

551
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,637
Ok, here's another question.
Let's say that a woman...

552
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:41,964
'digged' you, but you don't really like her,

553
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:44,026
that way. Now, how you
let her down real easy,

554
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:45,300
so her feelings aren't hurt?

555
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,237
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither.
How do you do this?

556
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,572
Just tell her, she's not your true love.

557
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,992
Everyone knows it what
happens when you find...

558
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:58,588
Hey. The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.

559
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,458
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess.
It's beautiful.

560
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:04,054
And what of my groom
to be, lord Farquaad.

561
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:05,154
What's he like?

562
00:44:05,254 --> 00:44:08,257
Well, let me put it this way, princess.

563
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:12,694
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

564
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:18,077
Oh no, Shrek. There are those
who think little of him.

565
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,835
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

566
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:25,628
You know, you're just
jealous that you can never...

567
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:28,110
...measure up to a great
ruler like lord Farquaad.

568
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,758
Yeah. Well maybe you're right
princess. But I'd like...

569
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:34,883
...you do that measuring
when you see him tomorrow

570
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:37,219
Tomorrow?

571
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,329
It will take that long?

572
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,717
Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No. That would take longer.

573
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,043
We can keep going.

574
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:48,118
But there are robbers in the woods.

575
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:49,272
Whoa, time out Shrek.

576
00:44:49,372 --> 00:44:51,241
Camp is definitely
something that sounds good.

577
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:52,341
Hey. Come on.

578
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:55,387
I'm scarier than anything
we're gonna see in this forest.

579
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:59,783
I need to find somewhere to camp, now.

580
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,832
Hey, over here.

581
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,898
Shrek, we can do better than that.

582
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,528
Now, I don't think this
is decent for princess.

583
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,907
No, no, it's perfect. It just
needs a few homey touches.

584
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:19,303
Homey touches? Like what?

585
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,538
A door.

586
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:24,083
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.

587
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,754
Do you want me to come in
and read you a bedtime story,

588
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:26,276
'cause I will...

589
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:30,647
I said good night.

590
00:45:32,282 --> 00:45:34,860
Shrek. What are you doing?

591
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,637
I just..., you know...

592
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:41,033
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.

593
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,498
And that one, that's Throwback.

594
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:52,361
The only Ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

595
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:56,381
Right. Yeah.

596
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:58,283
Hey, can you tell my
future form these stars?

597
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,536
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.

598
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,222
They tell stories. Look.

599
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:05,499
There's Blodna, the 'Flatulent'

600
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,960
You can guess what he is famous for.

601
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,670
All right. Now I know you're making this up.

602
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,105
No. Look. There he is and
there's the group of hunters...

603
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:14,759
...running away from his stag.

604
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:18,178
Man, there ain't nothing,
but a bunch of little dots.

605
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,588
You know donkey,

606
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:23,343
sometimes things are
more than they appear.

607
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:28,705
Forget it.

608
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:30,915
Hey Shrek.

609
00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:33,318
What are you gonna do when we
get our swamp back, anyway?

610
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,418
Our swamp?

611
00:46:34,518 --> 00:46:36,525
You know. When we're through
rescuing the princess...

612
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:37,364
...and all that stuff.

613
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:41,343
We? Donkey, there is
no we. There's no our.

614
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:43,829
There's just me and my swamp.

615
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:49,626
And the first thing I'm gonna do,
is build a ten foot wall around my land.

616
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:54,231
You cut me deep Shrek, you
cut me real deep just now.

617
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:57,649
You know, what I think? I
think this whole wall thing...

618
00:46:57,749 --> 00:46:59,762
...is just a way to keep somebody out.

619
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:03,073
No, do you think?

620
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:06,643
Are you hiding something?
- Never mind Donkey.

621
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:09,938
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

622
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:13,400
No. This is one of those drop
it and leave it alone things.

623
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,196
Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?

624
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:18,969
Oh, Why you block?
- I'm not blocking.

625
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:19,740
Oh yes you are.

626
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,074
Donkey, I'm warning you.
- Who are you trying to keep out?

627
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:23,285
Just tell me that Shrek. Who?

628
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,888
Everyone, ok?

629
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:31,153
Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

630
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:32,730
Hey, what's your problem Shrek?

631
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,505
What do you got against
the whole world anyway?

632
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,799
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok?

633
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,760
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

634
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,872
People take one look at me
and go: AAA... Help. Run.

635
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:48,368
A big stupid ugly Ogre.

636
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:51,906
They judge me, before they even know me.

637
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:56,302
That's why I'm better off alone.

638
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,320
You know what? When we met,

639
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,755
I didn't think you're just
a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

640
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:13,244
Yeah, I know.

641
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:16,630
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?

642
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:21,026
Well, there's a Cabby.
The small and annoying.

643
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:25,818
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big
shining one, right there.

644
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:27,307
That one, over there?

645
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:31,745
That's the moon.

646
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:57,104
Again. Show me again.

647
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:03,152
Mirror, mirror, show her to
me. Show me the princess.

648
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:13,161
Perfect.

649
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:20,783
Yeah. You know I like like
that. Oh come on baby...

650
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:25,150
Donkey. Wake up.
- What? -Wake up.

651
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:30,405
Morning. How do you like your eggs?

652
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:34,185
Good morning princess.
- What's all this about?

653
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:37,884
You know, we kind of got of
to a bad start yesterday...

654
00:50:37,984 --> 00:50:40,190
...and I wanted to make it up to you.

655
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,586
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

656
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,173
Thanks.

657
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:52,719
Well, eat up. We've got
a big day ahead of us.

658
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,526
Shrek.
- What? It's a compliment.

659
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,312
Better out than in I always say.

660
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:07,134
But that's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

661
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:10,863
Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.

662
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,683
You know. You're not
exactly what I've expected.

663
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:20,393
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

664
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:28,163
Princess.

665
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,199
What are you doing?

666
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:33,947
? Mn shery, for I am your saviour.

667
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:38,595
And I am rescuing you
from this green... beast.

668
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:43,003
Hey. That's my princess. Go find your own.

669
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:47,693
Please, monster. Can't you
see I'm a little busy here?

670
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:52,012
Look, pal. I don't know
who you think you are.

671
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,972
Oh, of course. How rude that was.

672
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:58,368
Please, let me introduce
myself. Oh marry men.

673
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,609
Man, that was annoying.

674
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:52,005
Oh, you little...

675
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,034
Shall we?

676
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:25,080
? all the forin?

677
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,484
Whoa, hold on, now.
Where did that come from?

678
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:32,171
What?
- That. Back there. That was amazing.

679
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,906
Where did you learn that?

680
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:39,912
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn
these things in case there's a...

681
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,497
There is an arrow in your butt.

682
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,402
What? Oh, would you look at that.

683
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:47,461
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

684
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,452
What's wrong?
- Shrek's hurt.

685
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:51,340
Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt.

686
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,884
Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
- Donkey, I'm ok.

687
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,553
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

688
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,138
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head?

689
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:01,391
Does anyone know how to handle...
- Donkey. Calm down.

690
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:03,923
If you want to help Shrek,
run into woods and...

691
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:05,938
...find me a blue flower with red thorns.

692
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:07,922
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it.

693
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:10,401
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

694
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,020
Don't die Shrek.

695
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,028
And if you see a long tunnel,
stay away from the light.

696
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,859
Donkey.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

697
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:17,241
Blue flower, red thorns.

698
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:21,328
What are the flowers for?
- For getting rid of the Donkey.

699
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,872
Now, you hold still and
I'll yank this thing out.

700
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:27,960
Hey. Easy with the yanking.
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

701
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,588
No, no. It's tender.
What you're doing here is the opposite...

702
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:35,766
Don't move.
- Ok, look. Time out.

703
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:37,984
Would you... Ok.

704
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,363
What do you propose we do?

705
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:41,132
Blue flower, red thorns.

706
00:54:41,232 --> 00:54:42,683
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

707
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:45,102
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colorblind.

708
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:47,271
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

709
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,667
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming.

710
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,236
Not good.

711
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:58,632
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.

712
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,413
Nothing happened.

713
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,331
We were just a...

714
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,293
Look if you want to be alone,
all you had to do is ask, ok?

715
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:12,921
Oh, come on. That's the
last thing on my mind.

716
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:17,317
The princess here was just... Au.

717
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:26,368
Hey, what's that? Is that...

718
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,585
There it is, princess.

719
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:01,697
Your future awaits you.
- That's Duloc?

720
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:05,716
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink
things lord Farquaad is...

721
00:57:05,816 --> 00:57:09,955
...compensating for something,
which I think needs, he has a

722
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:11,915
I guess we better move on.

723
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:16,311
Sure, but Shrek...

724
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,130
I'm worried about Donkey.
- What?

725
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,842
I mean. Look at him. He
doesn't look so good.

726
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:24,595
What are you talking about? I'm fine.
- Well, that's what they always say.

727
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:28,775
And the next thing you
know you're on your back.

728
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:32,102
Dead.
- You know she's right. You look awful.

729
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:35,564
Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I'll make you up some tea.

730
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:37,024
Well, I won't say nothing, but

731
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:38,469
I've got this twinge in my neck.

732
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:40,569
And if I turn my neck
like this, look. Au, see?

733
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:43,781
He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.

734
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:48,676
Hey, where are you going? Oh
man, I can't feel my thumbs.

735
00:57:48,776 --> 00:57:50,816
I don't have any thumbs.

736
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:54,059
I think I need a hug.

737
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:05,068
This is good. This is really good.

738
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:08,655
What is this?
- Wheat rat.

739
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:13,202
Rotisserie style.
- No kidding.

740
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:16,939
Oh, this is delicious.
- Well, they also great in stews.

741
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:22,054
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean wheat rat stew.

742
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:30,536
I guess I'll be dining a little different
late tomorrow night.

743
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,248
Maybe you can come visit
me in the swamp sometime.

744
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,708
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

745
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:41,104
Swamp toast, soup fish,
eye tartar. You name it.

746
00:58:42,406 --> 00:58:44,902
I'd like that.

747
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:56,620
Ah..., princess?
- Yes, Shrek?

748
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:01,583
I'm a... I was wondering.

749
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:06,129
Are you... a...

750
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:11,218
Are you gonna eat that?

751
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:19,001
Man, isn't this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.

752
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:23,397
Sunset? Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.

753
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:27,885
What?
- Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.

754
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,845
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?

755
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:34,391
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified.
You know I'll better go inside.

756
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,144
But don't feel bad, princess.
I used to be afraid of the dark too.

757
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:41,749
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm
still afraid of the dark.

758
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:46,837
Good night.
- Good night.

759
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:53,160
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.

760
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,062
Oh, what are you talking about.

761
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:57,539
Hey I don't wanna even hear.
Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts.

762
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,434
And I know that you two
are digging on each other.

763
00:59:59,534 --> 01:00:00,000
I can feel it.

764
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,346
Oh, you're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

765
01:00:04,446 --> 01:00:06,965
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up
and smell the fairemones.

766
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:09,760
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.

767
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,550
There's nothing to tell.

768
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,516
Besides, even if I did tell
her that... well you know.

769
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:19,328
I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't.

770
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,164
She's a princess and I'm...

771
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:24,625
...an Ogre.

772
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:27,586
Yeah, an Ogre.

773
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:32,132
Hey, where are you going?
- To get more firewood.

774
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:55,113
Princess. Princess Fiona?

775
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:04,164
Princess, where are you?

776
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:11,797
Princess?

777
01:01:13,507 --> 01:01:18,352
It's very spooky in here and
are we playing little games.

778
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:29,856
No, no.
- Help. Shrek. Shrek.

779
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:31,925
No. -Shrek.
- It's ok. It's ok.

780
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:35,220
What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.

781
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,995
It's me, in this body.
- Oh my god. You ate the princess.

782
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,643
Can you hear me?
- Donkey.

783
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:45,063
Listen, keep breathing.
I'll get you out of there.

784
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:47,874
Shrek. Shrek. Shrek.

785
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:52,421
This is me.

786
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:58,594
Princess? What happened to you?

787
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:02,472
You're a... different.

788
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:04,723
I'm ugly, ok?
- Yeah.

789
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,068
Was it something that you ate?

790
01:02:06,168 --> 01:02:08,170
'Cause I told Shrek those
rats were a bad idea.

791
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,413
You are what you eat, I say.

792
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:14,301
No. I've been this way as
long as I can remember.

793
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,970
What do you mean?
Look, I've never seen you like this before.

794
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:21,366
It only happens when the sun goes down.

795
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,314
By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm...

796
01:02:26,414 --> 01:02:29,899
...until you find true love's first kiss.

797
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:35,088
Then, take love's true form...

798
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:40,438
Oh, that's beautiful. I
didn't know you wrote poetry.

799
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:41,745
It's the spell.

800
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:46,350
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

801
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:50,811
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.

802
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,138
I was placed in a tower to await the day
when my true love would rescue me.

803
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:04,438
That's why I have to marry
lord Farquaad tomorrow,

804
01:03:04,538 --> 01:03:08,448
before the sun sets and
he sees me, like this?

805
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:14,736
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

806
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:19,783
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly.
But you only look like this at night.

807
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,451
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

808
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:23,796
But Donkey, I'm a princess.

809
01:03:23,896 --> 01:03:27,976
And this is not how a
princess is meant to look.

810
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:32,379
Princess. How about if
you don't marry Farquaad?

811
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:37,239
I have to. Only my true love's
kiss can brake the spell.

812
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:40,862
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.

813
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:44,474
And Shrek... Well you've
got a lot in common.

814
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:46,185
Shrek?

815
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:52,581
Princess, I... How is it going first of all?
Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.

816
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:58,405
I saw this flower and thought
of you because it's pretty.

817
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:04,411
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought
you may like it, because you're pretty.

818
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:08,807
But I like you anyway. A...

819
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:13,729
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.

820
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:22,648
Who could ever love a
piece so hideous and ugly?

821
01:04:22,748 --> 01:04:24,765
Princess and ugly don't go together.

822
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:29,573
That's why I can't stay here
with Shrek, but only chance...

823
01:04:29,673 --> 01:04:33,816
...to live happily ever after
is to marry my true love.

824
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:38,336
Don't you see, Donkey? That's
just how it has to be.

825
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:42,237
It's the only way to break the spell.

826
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:44,409
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.

827
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:47,454
No, no. You can't breathe the word.
No one must ever know.

828
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,165
What's the point of being unable to talk?
You got to keep secrets.

829
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:52,668
Promise you won't tell. Promise.

830
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:56,702
All right, all right. I won't
tell him. But you should.

831
01:04:56,802 --> 01:04:57,748
You know, before this is over,

832
01:04:57,848 --> 01:04:59,424
I'm going to need whole
lot of serious therapies.

833
01:04:59,524 --> 01:05:03,820
Look at my eye twitching.

834
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:30,389
I tell him, I tell him not.

835
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:34,393
I tell him. I tell him not.

836
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,378
I tell him.

837
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:40,774
Shrek. Shrek. There's something I want...

838
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:06,300
Shrek. Are you all right?

839
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,219
Perfect. Never been better.

840
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:12,873
I... There's something I have to tell you.

841
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:15,424
You don't have to tell
me anything, princess.

842
01:06:15,524 --> 01:06:16,919
I heard enough last night.

843
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:20,005
You've heard what I said?
- Every word.

844
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:21,298
I thought you'd understand?

845
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:22,793
Oh, I understand.

846
01:06:22,893 --> 01:06:27,313
Like you said, who could
love a hideous, ugly beast.

847
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:33,629
I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
- Yeah, well, it does.

848
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:39,721
Ah, right on time. Princess.
I brought you a little something.

849
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:49,968
What I missed? What I missed?

850
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:56,642
Princess Fiona.
- As promised. Now hand it over.

851
01:06:57,267 --> 01:07:03,382
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.

852
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:06,526
Before I change my mind.

853
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:11,064
Forgive me princess for startling you,
but you startled me.

854
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:15,018
For I've never seen such
a radiant beauty before.

855
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:19,414
I am lord Farquaad.
- Lord Farquaad?

856
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:29,995
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.

857
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:31,976
Oh. That is so sweet.

858
01:07:32,076 --> 01:07:35,664
You don't have to raise
good manners on the Ogre.

859
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:40,864
It's not like it has feelings.
- No. You're right. It doesn't.

860
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:45,889
Princess Fiona, beautiful
fair flawless Fiona.

861
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,313
I ask your hand in marriage.

862
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:52,833
Will you be the perfect
bride for the perfect groom?

863
01:07:57,953 --> 01:08:01,873
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

864
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:05,736
Excellent. I'll start the
plans for tomorrow we wedd...

865
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:09,715
No. I mean I... Why wait?

866
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:13,885
Let's get married today. Before sunset.

867
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:17,831
Oh, anxious are we? You're
right. The sooner, the better.

868
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:20,426
There's so much to do.

869
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:24,267
There is the camera, the
cake, the band, the guests...

870
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,423
Captain. Round up some guests.

871
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,859
Farewell Ogre.

872
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:31,345
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.

873
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:32,445
Yeah, so what.

874
01:08:32,545 --> 01:08:35,474
Shrek. There's something
about her that you don't know.

875
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:39,436
I talked to her last night. She's...
- Yeah I know you talked to her last night.

876
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:42,348
You're great pal, aren't you?
Now, if you two are such...

877
01:08:42,448 --> 01:08:44,608
...good friend, why didn't
you follow her home?

878
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,986
Shrek. I want to go with you.
- I told you, didn't I?

879
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:50,378
You're not coming home with me.

880
01:08:50,478 --> 01:08:53,676
I live alone. My swamp,
me and nobody else.

881
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:55,422
Understand? Nobody.

882
01:08:55,522 --> 01:09:00,472
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys.

883
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:02,896
But. I thought...

884
01:09:02,996 --> 01:09:06,320
Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.

885
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:12,611
Shrek.

886
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,502
Donkey?

887
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:34,778
What are you doing?

888
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:36,215
I was thinking of all the people,

889
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:38,115
you would recognize a
wall when you see one.

890
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:42,034
Well, yeah. But the wall
supposed to go around my swamp.

891
01:11:42,134 --> 01:11:43,120
Not through it.

892
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,039
It is around your half.
See? That's your half and this is my half.

893
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:48,767
Oh, your half?

894
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:52,045
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

895
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:54,761
I did half the work. I get
half the booty. Now hand me...

896
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:57,384
...that big old rock, the one
that looks like your head...

897
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,779
Back off.
- No. You back off.

898
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:01,847
This is my swamp.
- Our swamp.

899
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:03,682
Let go, Donkey.
- You let go.

900
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,767
Stubborn jackass.
- Smelly Ogre.

901
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,867
Fine.

902
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:10,355
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.

903
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:12,152
Well, I'm through with you.

904
01:12:12,252 --> 01:12:14,985
Well, you know. You
were always me, me, me.

905
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,404
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn.

906
01:12:17,504 --> 01:12:21,174
So you just shut up and pay attention.

907
01:12:21,325 --> 01:12:24,578
You are mean to me, you insult me,
you don't appreciate anything that I do.

908
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:27,039
You're always pushing me
around or pushing me away.

909
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:31,460
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

910
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,130
Because that's what friend do.
They forgive each other.

911
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:41,350
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey.
I forgive you for stabbing me in the back.

912
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:48,143
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy.
You're afraid of your own feelings.

913
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:50,278
Go away.
- See? There you are, doing it again.

914
01:12:50,378 --> 01:12:51,605
Just like you did it to Fiona.

915
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,107
And all she ever do, was like you.
Maybe even love you.

916
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:58,503
Love me? She said I was
ugly. A hideous creature.

917
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:00,490
I heard that you two were talking.

918
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:03,575
She wasn't talking about you.
She was talking about...

919
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:07,137
...somebody else.

920
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:12,292
She wasn't talking about me?
Well then, who was she talking about?

921
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:16,004
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?

922
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:18,398
Donkey.
- No.

923
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:22,945
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?

924
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,727
I'm sorry.

925
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:35,123
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

926
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:40,291
Can you forgive me?

927
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:43,699
Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
- Right.

928
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:47,261
Friends?
- Friends.

929
01:13:47,511 --> 01:13:51,807
So? What did Fiona said about me?

930
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,794
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.

931
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:59,398
The wedding. We'll never make it in time.

932
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:01,800
Never fear. For where there is a will,
there is a way.

933
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:06,196
And I have I way.

934
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:11,159
Donkey?

935
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:16,706
I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
- Oh, come here, you.

936
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:20,027
All right. All right.
Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.

937
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:22,070
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.

938
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:26,466
I hadn't have a chance to
install seat belts, yet.

939
01:14:57,205 --> 01:15:02,000
People of Duloc. We gather here today...

940
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,501
...to bear witness to
reunion of our new king...

941
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:11,970
Excuse me. Could you just
skip ahead to 'I do's'?

942
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:15,934
Go on.

943
01:15:18,187 --> 01:15:24,483
Go ahead and have some fun,
if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

944
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:28,345
Shrek, wait, wait a minute.
You want to do this right, don't you?

945
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:31,723
What are you talking about?
- It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.

946
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:34,268
The priest is going to say:
'Speak now or forever hold your peace'.

947
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,812
And that's where you say: 'I object'.

948
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:38,091
I don't have time for this.

949
01:15:38,191 --> 01:15:40,190
Wait, wait. What are
you doing? Listen to me.

950
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:41,650
Look, you love this woman, don't you?

951
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,860
Yes.
- You want to hold her.

952
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,582
Yes.
- Please her.

953
01:15:44,682 --> 01:15:45,237
Yes.

954
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:48,515
Then you got to, got to
try a little tender love.

955
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:50,593
The chicks love that romantic crap.

956
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:53,829
All right. Cut it out. When
does this guy say the line?

957
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,539
We got to check it out.

958
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:58,869
And as so by the power of these two...

959
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:00,794
What do you see?

960
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:05,190
I now pronounce you...
- There they go.

961
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:11,346
...he all ready said it.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

962
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:14,032
I object.

963
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:15,976
Shrek?

964
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:20,372
Oh, now what does he want?

965
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:25,377
Hi, everyone. Having a
good time, aren't you?

966
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:27,446
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

967
01:16:27,546 --> 01:16:28,909
What are you doing here?

968
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:32,493
Really, it's rude enough being
alive, when no one wants you.

969
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:34,411
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...

970
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:38,757
Fiona. I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

971
01:16:38,857 --> 01:16:41,710
Well it's a little late for that.
So if you'll excuse me.

972
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,463
But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

973
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:48,809
Because, because he's just marrying you
so he can be king.

974
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:52,429
Outrageous. Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.

975
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:58,113
What do you know about true love?
- Well, I... I'm in...

976
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:01,496
Oh, this is precious.

977
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:06,043
The Ogre has fallen in
love with the princess.

978
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:10,881
Laugh.

979
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,972
Shrek. Is this true?

980
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:24,378
Who cares. It's preposterious.
Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss...

981
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:28,558
...away for our happily
ever after. Now kiss me.

982
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:36,907
By night one way, by day another.

983
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:42,412
I wanted to show you before.

984
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:07,938
Well. That explains a lot.

985
01:18:08,822 --> 01:18:15,012
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards.
I order you to get them out of my sight.

986
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:19,408
Now. Get them. Get them, both.
- No.

987
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:24,822
This marriage is minding, and
that makes me king. See? See?

988
01:18:24,922 --> 01:18:26,398
Shrek.
- No.

989
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:30,918
Don't just stand there, you dogs.
- Get out of my way.

990
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:41,597
No. Shrek.

991
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:44,291
And as for you my wife.
- Fiona.

992
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:49,505
I'll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days.

993
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:54,280
I will have order. I will have potential.
I will have...

994
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,775
All right, nobody move.

995
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:03,936
I got a dragon here and
I'm not afraid to use it.

996
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:08,332
I'm a donkey on the edge.

997
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:14,004
Celebrity marriages. They
never last, do they?

998
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,759
Go ahead Shrek.

999
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:23,305
Fiona?
- Yes, Shrek?

1000
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:27,935
I love you.

1001
01:19:28,226 --> 01:19:30,771
Really?

1002
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:34,441
Really, really.

1003
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:38,987
I love you too.

1004
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:50,082
A time for true love's first kiss...

1005
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:29,037
Fiona?

1006
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:33,917
Fiona? Are you all right?

1007
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:39,756
Yes. But I don't understand.

1008
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:44,303
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1009
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:49,279
But you are beautiful.

1010
01:20:49,379 --> 01:20:53,645
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

1011
01:21:39,467 --> 01:21:43,363
God bless us, everyone.
