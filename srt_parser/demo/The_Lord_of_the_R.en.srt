1
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,504
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:30,681
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:41,400
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:46,113
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,538
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,359
No! No!

7
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,569
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,828
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,331
No!

10
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,377
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,864
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,159
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,787
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:08,172
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,519
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:26,940
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,912
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,958
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:49,296
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:57,679
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57,846 --> 00:05:01,099
It's not natural.
None of it.

22
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,355
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:08,774
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:12,236
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,905
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,782
You never know.

27
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:20,244
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,833
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:29,086
It is special.

30
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,883
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,597
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:44,560
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:49,273
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:51,859
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:55,153
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,281
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,375
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:26,977
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:29,354
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,857
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:36,320
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:41,366
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:46,330
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:48,624
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:02,721
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,060
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,647
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,995
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,790
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:32,709
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,422
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,143
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:53,313
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,693
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,826
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:42,863
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,949
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:48,702
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:51,288
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,665
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,751
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:00,047
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,761
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,487
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:27,616
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:30,452
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,330
Where is it?

68
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:37,250
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:41,630
My precious.

70
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:45,759
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:50,013
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:46,862
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,572
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:51,241
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,790
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,641
It burns!

77
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,102
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:22,105
It freezes!

79
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,109
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,945
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:36,620
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,414
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:43,168
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,046
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,758
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:55,639
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,939
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,942
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,990
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:16,159
We swears.

91
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,828
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:23,291
We swears...

93
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,255
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:32,217
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,344
...on the precious.

96
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,721
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:41,017
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:43,186
Yes...

99
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,273
...on the precious.

100
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:51,069
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,738
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,244
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,162
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,374
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:20,348
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,020
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,605
Yes.

108
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:41,119
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:53,548
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:58,553
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:03,016
They can't make us.
Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:06,644
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:12,776
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:15,820
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:21,117
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

116
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,916
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,545
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:34,923
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,634
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,427
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,721
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,945
Merry!

123
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,406
Merry!

124
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:08,748
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,750
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:16,172
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:20,301
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:23,638
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:31,229
Merry!

130
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,731
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:39,070
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:42,157
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:46,870
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,749
Stop it!

135
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,588
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,885
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:05,305
You want some? Huh?

138
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:08,892
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,397
Merry.

140
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,733
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,987
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,698
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:27,202
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,623
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,919
What is it?
What do you smell?

146
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,213
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,717
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,928
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,473
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,582
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,585
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,504
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:24,968
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,015
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:34,143
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,314
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:13,016
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:16,644
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,148
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.

160
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,236
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:29,699
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:33,536
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:46,966
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,927
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:53,681
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:56,851
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,979
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:08,071
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:10,823
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:13,826
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:15,953
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,548
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:33,346
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

174
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:36,766
<i>...and Mordor?</i>

175
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:44,065
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:47,902
<i>...and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,370
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:57,537 --> 00:20:01,124
<i>...we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,394
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:25,231
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,986
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,950
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,163
<i>...and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:55,803
I want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks!

185
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,638
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:00,808
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:04,187
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:07,190
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:12,779
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:16,532
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:19,535
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,704
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:36,969
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:40,056
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:44,769
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,354
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,398
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,359
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,742
<i>We have only to
remove those who oppose us.</i>

200
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:02,787
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,041
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,043
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,462
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:16,300
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:19,345
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,180
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:24,350
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:27,061
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:30,231
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:34,110
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,783
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:48,708
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,556
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,726
<i>...is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:19,488
Théodred.

216
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,324
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:43,846
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,516
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,027
He's alive.

220
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:31,060
Théodred.

221
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:47,451
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,413
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:55,543
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:58,421
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:05,469
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:09,140
Gríma.

227
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:12,476
Gríma.

228
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,564
Gríma.

229
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:20,443
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:24,447
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,950
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:41,589
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:44,216
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:49,430
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:52,141
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,312
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,647
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:01,859
What was the promised price, Gríma?

239
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,780
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,878
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,047
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:35,434
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:36,769
Too much.

244
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:43,901
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:48,864
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:51,659
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,286
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,666
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,043
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,255
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:38,497
Keep breathing.
That's the key.

252
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:40,416
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:48,382
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:06,567
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:08,736
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:11,238
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,911
Merry!

258
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:18,621
Merry!

259
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:25,502
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,139
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:40,184
It's the trees.

262
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:41,977
What?

263
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:46,148
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:50,819
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,529
...and come alive.

266
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,448
Alive?

267
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:57,034
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:00,496
...talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:02,539
...even move.

270
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,377
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:10,673
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,258
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:15,719
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:20,307
What about them?

275
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:22,351
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:26,814
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:34,738
What about their legs?

278
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,241
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,870
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:48,585
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,879
Alive?

282
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:58,137
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:03,892
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,104
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,859
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.

286
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:14,445
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,282
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,658
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:30,044
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,885
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:39,762
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,730
Go on.

293
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:51,398
Call for help.

294
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:53,859
Squeal.

295
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:57,279
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:07,873
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:34,608
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:38,028
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:11,145
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,981
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:46,138
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,182
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:53,187
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:04,907
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:07,701
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:10,829
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:21,423
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:25,969
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:29,431
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:34,853
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:37,272
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,737
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:45,864
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:50,827
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,746
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:58,126
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:01,213
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,465
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,096
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,473
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,601
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:17,229
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:20,482
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:23,819
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:26,989
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,286
We left none alive.

327
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:35,872
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:42,588
Dead?

329
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:47,301
I am sorry.

330
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:55,142
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,648
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:04,526
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:11,950
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,620
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,874
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,084
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,595
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:29,361
We failed them.

339
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,627
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:49,131
And the other.

341
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,476
They crawled.

342
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:07,774
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:21,747
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:39,306
They ran over here.

345
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:44,186
They were followed.

346
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:49,107
The belt!

347
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:54,196
Run!

348
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:59,224
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,208
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:08,502
Fangorn?

351
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,296
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:29,022 --> 00:38:32,025
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.

353
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,160
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,376
Come here!

355
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:57,467
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,562
He's gone.

357
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,951
Merry!

358
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:38,800
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:47,475
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,615
Little Orcs.

361
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:04,117
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:06,161
Tree?

363
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:09,331
I am no tree!

364
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,750
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,461
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:16,963
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,465
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:20,467
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:24,888
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,015
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,267
Side?

372
00:40:29,476 --> 00:40:32,354
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:38,026
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,490
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:46,242
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,703
Hobbits?

377
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:54,876
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:56,002 --> 00:40:59,297
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:02,884
They come with fire.

380
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,679
They come with axes.

381
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:10,684
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:14,688
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:17,691
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:19,693
Halflings!

385
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,027
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:23,530
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:27,450
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:32,455
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:35,208
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,211
Saruman.

391
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:52,475
See? See?

392
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:55,061
We've led you out.

393
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,772
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,445
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:11,786
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:13,455 --> 00:42:17,959
Oh! It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:20,754
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:26,259
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:32,015
Come, Hobbits! Come!
We go quickly.

400
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:37,896
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:40,774
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:44,486
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:48,740
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,366
Come quickly.

405
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:54,621
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:59,125
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.

407
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,544
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:05,131
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:09,636
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,098
And we are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:17,560
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,035
Here.

413
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:37,247
What does it eats?

414
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,374
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:47,298
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:51,219
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:56,975
We must starve!

418
00:43:57,142 --> 00:43:59,561
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!

419
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,522
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:05,567
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:10,572
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:11,156 --> 00:44:13,992
Not like master.

423
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:17,453
Master cares.

424
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,498
Master knows.

425
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,919
Yes.

426
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:27,714
Precious.

427
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,929
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:40,977
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:41,644 --> 00:44:42,812
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:17,180
There are dead things!

431
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,140
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:27,941
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:32,237
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:36,032
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:38,576
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:41,496
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:44,958
This way.

438
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:47,877
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:53,466
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:57,804
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:25,498
Frodo!

442
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:14,672
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:16,632
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:18,760
Are you all right?

445
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,583
So bright.

446
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:54,587
So beautiful.

447
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:58,591
Our precious.

448
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:01,511
What did you say?

449
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:03,971
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:08,226
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:13,439
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:15,108
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:15,274 --> 00:48:17,151
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:21,364
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,116
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:23,324 --> 00:48:27,829
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:30,998
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:32,959
Were you?

459
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,380
Sméagol.

460
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:44,637
What did you call me?

461
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,724
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,644
A long time ago.

463
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:54,647
My name.

464
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:57,233
My name.

465
00:49:04,157 --> 00:49:06,659
Sméagol.

466
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:12,373
Black Riders!

467
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,875
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,762
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:30,558
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:34,020
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:34,187 --> 00:49:37,106
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,384
Wraiths!

473
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:07,762
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:17,813
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:21,484
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:23,694 --> 00:50:25,821
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:27,240
I'm here.

478
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:44,799
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:49,262
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:58,020
Orc blood.

481
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,782
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:13,035
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:16,664
This forest is old.

484
00:51:17,498 --> 00:51:19,500
Very old.

485
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,504
Full of memory...

486
00:51:26,132 --> 00:51:28,509
...and anger.

487
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,518
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:39,186
Gimli!

489
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:41,314
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:46,861
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:49,405
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:54,327
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:54,827 --> 00:51:57,163
Talking trees.

494
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,833
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:04,253
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:20,645
The White Wizard approaches.

497
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:31,113
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

498
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:42,958
We must be quick.

499
00:52:58,516 --> 00:53:02,186
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

500
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,188
Where are they?

501
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:07,900
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

502
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:12,363
They met someone they did not expect.

503
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,657
Does that comfort you?

504
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,784
Who are you?

505
00:53:18,244 --> 00:53:20,246
Show yourself!

506
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,132
It cannot be.

507
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:35,136
Forgive me.

508
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:38,639
I mistook you for Saruman.

509
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:42,184
I am Saruman.

510
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:47,648
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

511
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:50,067
You fell.

512
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:54,071
Through fire...

513
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:55,531
...and water.

514
00:53:56,991 --> 00:53:59,535
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

515
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:03,456
<i>...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

516
00:54:19,305 --> 00:54:22,016
<i>Until at last
I threw down my enemy...</i>

517
00:54:22,183 --> 00:54:26,687
<i>...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

518
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:35,237
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

519
00:54:35,988 --> 00:54:40,075
<i>...and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

520
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:43,913
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

521
00:54:44,205 --> 00:54:48,709
<i>...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

522
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:52,922
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

523
00:54:53,214 --> 00:54:56,008
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

524
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,471
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

525
00:55:00,638 --> 00:55:02,223
...until my task is done.

526
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,517
Gandalf.

527
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:07,228
Gandalf?

528
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:09,396
Yes.

529
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:13,984
That was what they used to call me.

530
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:19,114
Gandalf the Grey.

531
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:22,243
That was my name.

532
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:23,828
Gandalf.

533
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,873
I am Gandalf the White.

534
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:33,963
And I come back to you now...

535
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:36,632
...at the turn of the tide.

536
00:55:37,758 --> 00:55:40,761
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

537
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:44,640
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

538
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:47,601
That is no short distance!

539
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:51,063
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

540
00:55:51,272 --> 00:55:53,357
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

541
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:56,944
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

542
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:59,113
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

543
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,200
...in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested--?

544
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,290
I mean, charming...

545
00:56:09,456 --> 00:56:12,209
...quite charming forest.

546
00:56:12,793 --> 00:56:16,422
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

547
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:20,926
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

548
00:56:21,093 --> 00:56:24,555
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

549
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:28,058
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

550
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:30,394
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

551
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:34,982
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

552
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:44,241
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

553
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:48,037
The Ents are going to wake up...

554
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:53,083
- ...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

555
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,002
Oh, that's good.

556
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:57,880
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

557
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:01,216
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

558
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:05,054
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

559
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,974
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

560
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:32,665
That is one of the Mearas...

561
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:35,626
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

562
00:57:53,227 --> 00:57:55,521
Shadowfax.

563
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,693
He is the lord of all horses...

564
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,240
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

565
00:58:20,504 --> 00:58:24,091
<i>O rowan mine</i>

566
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:28,053
<i>I saw you shine</i>

567
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,765
<i>Upon a summer's day</i>

568
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:37,354
<i>Upon your head
How golden-red</i>

569
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:42,234
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

570
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:44,820
Such a beautiful verse.

571
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:49,908
- Is it much further?
- Bru-Ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

572
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,328
You might call it far, perhaps.

573
00:58:54,246 --> 00:58:58,042
My home lies deep in the forest...

574
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,129
...near the roots of the mountain.

575
00:59:03,464 --> 00:59:07,134
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

576
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:11,346
And safe is where I'll keep you.

577
00:59:11,597 --> 00:59:15,976
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

578
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,354
It's one of my own compositions.

579
00:59:19,521 --> 00:59:20,731
Right.

580
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:27,029
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

581
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:32,076
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

582
00:59:32,242 --> 00:59:38,707
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

583
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:43,003
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

584
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,090
<i>Come back to me</i>

585
00:59:46,632 --> 00:59:51,095
<i>Come back to me</i>

586
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:57,684
<i>And say my land is best</i>

587
00:59:59,186 --> 01:00:01,146
Oh.

588
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,821
Sleep, little Shirelings.

589
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:12,574
Heed no nightly noise.

590
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:16,662
Sleep till morning light.

591
01:00:18,288 --> 01:00:22,459
I have business in the forest.

592
01:00:22,626 --> 01:00:28,173
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

593
01:00:29,383 --> 01:00:34,054
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

594
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:39,935
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

595
01:00:49,486 --> 01:00:53,740
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

596
01:00:54,575 --> 01:00:57,161
Sauron will suffer no rival.

597
01:00:57,578 --> 01:01:01,874
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

598
01:01:02,082 --> 01:01:05,460
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

599
01:01:06,503 --> 01:01:08,463
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

600
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:11,216
The rumor has reached him.

601
01:01:11,383 --> 01:01:14,344
The heir of Númenor still lives.

602
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,140
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

603
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:21,643
He fears what you may become.

604
01:01:22,895 --> 01:01:26,315
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

605
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,110
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

606
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:31,778
War is coming.

607
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:35,532
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

608
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:38,118
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

609
01:01:38,285 --> 01:01:41,997
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

610
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:45,250
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

611
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:50,130
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

612
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:53,091
But for all their cunning...

613
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:55,844
...we have one advantage.

614
01:01:57,971 --> 01:02:00,557
The Ring remains hidden.

615
01:02:01,642 --> 01:02:03,560
And that we should seek to destroy it...

616
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:06,688
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

617
01:02:07,272 --> 01:02:10,609
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

618
01:02:10,776 --> 01:02:12,277
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

619
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:16,531
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

620
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:19,326
We must trust now in Frodo.

621
01:02:19,493 --> 01:02:21,328
Everything depends upon speed...

622
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:24,498
...and the secrecy of his quest.

623
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,795
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

624
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:33,423
Frodo must finish this task alone.

625
01:02:34,174 --> 01:02:36,468
He's not alone.

626
01:02:36,677 --> 01:02:38,345
Sam went with him.

627
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:40,222
Did he?

628
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:45,018
Did he, indeed? Good.

629
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:48,063
Yes, very good.

630
01:02:56,071 --> 01:03:00,951
The Black Gate of Mordor.

631
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:06,248
Oh, save us.

632
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:15,257
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

633
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:21,972
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

634
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:25,559
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

635
01:03:25,726 --> 01:03:26,977
I did.

636
01:03:35,736 --> 01:03:37,738
That's it, then.

637
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:40,574
We can't get past that.

638
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:27,120
Look!

639
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:28,747
The gate.

640
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:30,123
It's opening!

641
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:39,549
I can see a way down.

642
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,386
Sam, no!

643
01:04:44,554 --> 01:04:45,931
Master!

644
01:06:09,764 --> 01:06:13,310
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

645
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:17,230
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

646
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:19,524
- Now!
- No!

647
01:06:20,066 --> 01:06:22,068
No! No, master!

648
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:25,238
They catch you! They catch you!

649
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:29,075
Don't take it to him.

650
01:06:32,037 --> 01:06:34,748
He wants the precious.

651
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:37,959
Always he is looking for it.

652
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:42,047
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

653
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:46,176
But we mustn't let him have it.

654
01:06:52,557 --> 01:06:54,684
No! There's another way.

655
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:57,521
More secret. A dark way.

656
01:06:57,812 --> 01:07:01,483
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

657
01:07:01,942 --> 01:07:03,068
He's up to something.

658
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,238
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

659
01:07:06,446 --> 01:07:09,157
Yes. There's a path...

660
01:07:09,324 --> 01:07:11,826
...and some stairs.

661
01:07:12,035 --> 01:07:13,703
And then...

662
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:17,207
...a tunnel.

663
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:32,973
He's led us this far, Sam.

664
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,558
Mr. Frodo, no.

665
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,143
He's been true to his word.

666
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:43,233
No.

667
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,987
Lead the way, Sméagol.

668
01:07:47,612 --> 01:07:51,533
Good Sméagol always helps.

669
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:26,526
Hello?

670
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:31,031
Treebeard?

671
01:08:31,656 --> 01:08:33,033
Where has he gone?

672
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,660
I had the loveliest dream last night.

673
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:38,997
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

674
01:08:39,164 --> 01:08:41,666
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

675
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:44,085
...you were sick.

676
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:48,548
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

677
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:53,970
Did you hear that?

678
01:09:01,061 --> 01:09:02,562
There it is again.

679
01:09:03,396 --> 01:09:06,983
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

680
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:14,741
You just said something... Treeish.

681
01:09:14,908 --> 01:09:18,912
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.

682
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:28,338
You're taller.

683
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,382
- Who?
- You!

684
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,175
- Than what?
- Than me!

685
01:09:32,676 --> 01:09:34,803
I've always been taller than you.

686
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:39,599
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

687
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:41,976
Please, Merry.

688
01:09:42,143 --> 01:09:45,980
You're what?
Three-foot-six? At the most?

689
01:09:46,606 --> 01:09:48,733
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

690
01:09:51,528 --> 01:09:53,780
3'8"!

691
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,617
Three-foot-eight.

692
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,539
You did something.

693
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:09,921
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

694
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,340
Merry!

695
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:14,843
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

696
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:18,930
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

697
01:10:19,139 --> 01:10:21,266
Give me it back. Merry!

698
01:10:23,143 --> 01:10:24,436
What's happening?!

699
01:10:25,311 --> 01:10:26,771
It's got my leg!

700
01:10:27,147 --> 01:10:28,648
Merry!

701
01:10:37,157 --> 01:10:38,366
No!

702
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:49,669
Help!

703
01:10:56,342 --> 01:10:58,219
Away with you.

704
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,180
You should not be waking.

705
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:05,685
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

706
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:08,813
Go to sleep.

707
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:10,982
Away with you.

708
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:14,486
Come, the forest is waking up.

709
01:11:15,028 --> 01:11:16,988
It isn't safe.

710
01:11:19,616 --> 01:11:23,536
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

711
01:11:23,703 --> 01:11:26,748
Anger festers in their hearts.

712
01:11:27,582 --> 01:11:29,209
Black are their thoughts.

713
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:31,920
Strong is their hate.

714
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:34,839
They will harm you if they can.

715
01:11:35,006 --> 01:11:38,593
There are too few of us now.

716
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,764
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

717
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:46,017
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

718
01:11:46,226 --> 01:11:49,395
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-Ra-hroom.

719
01:11:49,562 --> 01:11:55,193
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

720
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,615
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

721
01:12:00,865 --> 01:12:02,283
Oh, I'm sorry.

722
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:06,371
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

723
01:12:06,538 --> 01:12:09,791
We lost them.

724
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:15,046
And now we cannot find them.

725
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:21,427
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

726
01:12:21,594 --> 01:12:24,180
Can't say that I have.

727
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:26,766
You, Pip?

728
01:12:28,184 --> 01:12:30,562
What do they look like?

729
01:12:33,022 --> 01:12:37,694
I don't remember now.

730
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:58,006
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

731
01:12:58,798 --> 01:13:01,426
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

732
01:13:02,093 --> 01:13:05,013
<i>...whose mind is overthrown.</i>

733
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:09,434
<i>Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

734
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:13,271
My lord, your son...

735
01:13:13,438 --> 01:13:15,607
...he is dead.

736
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:18,943
My lord?

737
01:13:20,194 --> 01:13:21,362
Uncle?

738
01:13:28,161 --> 01:13:30,455
Will you not go to him?

739
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:35,960
Will you do nothing?

740
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:38,129
Be careful what you say.

741
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:40,465
Do not look for welcome here.

742
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,701
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

743
01:14:08,868 --> 01:14:11,037
What a tragedy for the king...

744
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:14,207
...to lose his only son and heir.

745
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:19,837
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

746
01:14:20,004 --> 01:14:24,926
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

747
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:26,552
Leave me alone, snake!

748
01:14:28,012 --> 01:14:29,681
Oh, but you are alone.

749
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:36,062
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

750
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:39,691
...in the bitter watches of the night...

751
01:14:39,899 --> 01:14:43,528
...when all your life seems to shrink.

752
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:47,907
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

753
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:52,662
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

754
01:14:54,914 --> 01:14:56,791
So fair.

755
01:14:58,042 --> 01:14:59,419
So cold.

756
01:15:01,212 --> 01:15:03,423
Like a morning of pale spring...

757
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:07,051
...still clinging to winter's chill.

758
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:23,317
Your words are poison.

759
01:16:55,827 --> 01:16:58,329
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

760
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,593
Ah.

761
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,556
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

762
01:17:18,057 --> 01:17:20,601
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

763
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:40,913
- Your staff.
- Hm? Oh...

764
01:17:43,082 --> 01:17:46,586
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

765
01:18:05,396 --> 01:18:08,274
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

766
01:18:16,616 --> 01:18:18,201
He's a herald of woe.

767
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:22,747
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

768
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:25,291
...Théoden King.

769
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,544
He's not welcome.

770
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:34,759
Why should I welcome you...

771
01:18:35,259 --> 01:18:38,930
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

772
01:18:39,138 --> 01:18:42,433
A just question, my liege.

773
01:18:42,642 --> 01:18:45,436
Late is the hour...

774
01:18:45,645 --> 01:18:49,649
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

775
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:52,443
Láthspell I name him.

776
01:18:52,652 --> 01:18:55,529
Ill news is an ill guest.

777
01:18:55,696 --> 01:19:00,284
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

778
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:02,370
I have not passed
through fire and death...

779
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:05,790
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

780
01:19:06,749 --> 01:19:08,876
His staff.

781
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:13,172
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

782
01:19:16,509 --> 01:19:18,469
Théoden...

783
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:21,597
...son of Thengel...

784
01:19:23,349 --> 01:19:25,726
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

785
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:31,983
I would stay still if I were you.

786
01:19:32,191 --> 01:19:34,235
Hearken to me!

787
01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:41,867
I release you...

788
01:19:42,034 --> 01:19:43,995
...from the spell.

789
01:19:55,548 --> 01:19:58,592
You have no power here...

790
01:19:58,843 --> 01:20:02,388
...Gandalf the Grey.

791
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:12,857
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

792
01:20:22,283 --> 01:20:23,826
Wait.

793
01:20:25,244 --> 01:20:29,081
If I go, Théoden dies.

794
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,001
You did not kill me...

795
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:34,378
...you will not kill him.

796
01:20:38,257 --> 01:20:39,967
Rohan is mine.

797
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,803
Be gone.

798
01:21:27,306 --> 01:21:29,475
I know your face.

799
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:35,314
Éowyn.

800
01:21:37,608 --> 01:21:38,859
Éowyn.

801
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:48,327
Gandalf?

802
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:51,747
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

803
01:22:05,136 --> 01:22:07,721
Dark have been my dreams of late.

804
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:15,646
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

805
01:22:15,855 --> 01:22:18,774
...if they grasped your sword.

806
01:23:03,903 --> 01:23:05,905
I've only...

807
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:09,116
...ever served you, my lord.

808
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:14,288
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

809
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:17,249
Send me not from your sight.

810
01:23:19,543 --> 01:23:22,254
No, my lord! No, my lord.

811
01:23:22,463 --> 01:23:23,672
Let him go.

812
01:23:24,423 --> 01:23:27,593
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

813
01:23:36,727 --> 01:23:39,063
Get out of my way!

814
01:23:41,273 --> 01:23:44,443
Hail, Théoden King!

815
01:24:09,093 --> 01:24:11,637
Where is Théodred?

816
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,142
Where is my son?

817
01:25:44,396 --> 01:25:46,106
Simbelmynë.

818
01:25:51,236 --> 01:25:54,865
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

819
01:25:58,702 --> 01:26:01,664
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

820
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:07,670
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

821
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:12,841
The young perish and the old linger.

822
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:15,552
That I should live...

823
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:19,098
...to see the last days of my house.

824
01:26:20,307 --> 01:26:24,186
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

825
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:30,609
No parent should have to bury
their child.

826
01:26:47,334 --> 01:26:49,211
He was strong in life.

827
01:26:50,295 --> 01:26:53,882
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

828
01:27:38,469 --> 01:27:40,345
They had no warning.

829
01:27:40,512 --> 01:27:42,931
They were unarmed.

830
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:47,436
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

831
01:27:48,353 --> 01:27:50,314
Rick, cot and tree.

832
01:27:50,689 --> 01:27:52,816
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

833
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:57,863
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

834
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:02,451
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

835
01:28:04,036 --> 01:28:07,039
Ride out and meet him head on.

836
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:11,293
Draw him away from your women
and children.

837
01:28:11,627 --> 01:28:13,253
You must fight.

838
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,257
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

839
01:28:17,424 --> 01:28:19,051
Éomer is loyal to you.

840
01:28:19,218 --> 01:28:21,929
His men will return
and fight for their king.

841
01:28:22,095 --> 01:28:26,016
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

842
01:28:29,728 --> 01:28:31,897
Éomer cannot help us.

843
01:28:32,523 --> 01:28:34,316
I know what it is you want of me...

844
01:28:34,483 --> 01:28:37,736
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

845
01:28:39,404 --> 01:28:41,114
I will not risk open war.

846
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:46,745
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

847
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,584
When last I looked...

848
01:28:53,043 --> 01:28:56,672
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

849
01:29:03,554 --> 01:29:05,806
Then what is the king's decision?

850
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:12,771
<i>By order of the king...</i>

851
01:29:12,938 --> 01:29:14,356
...the city must empty.

852
01:29:15,524 --> 01:29:18,402
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

853
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:22,573
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

854
01:29:22,781 --> 01:29:24,283
Helm's Deep.

855
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:27,995
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

856
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:30,122
Who will defend them if not their king?

857
01:29:30,289 --> 01:29:32,749
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

858
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:34,751
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

859
01:29:34,918 --> 01:29:38,797
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

860
01:29:38,964 --> 01:29:41,174
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

861
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:43,510
What they will get is a massacre.

862
01:29:45,053 --> 01:29:47,556
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

863
01:29:48,432 --> 01:29:51,810
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

864
01:29:52,227 --> 01:29:55,105
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

865
01:29:55,564 --> 01:29:58,358
The people of Rohan will need you.

866
01:29:58,734 --> 01:30:01,194
The defenses have to hold.

867
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:04,364
They will hold.

868
01:30:08,368 --> 01:30:10,662
The Grey Pilgrim.

869
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:13,457
That's what they used to call me.

870
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:18,754
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

871
01:30:20,339 --> 01:30:22,549
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

872
01:30:23,091 --> 01:30:26,386
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

873
01:30:27,262 --> 01:30:29,973
At dawn, look to the east.

874
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,683
Go.

875
01:30:59,002 --> 01:31:02,381
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

876
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,463
His name is Brego.

877
01:31:44,965 --> 01:31:46,925
He was my cousin's horse.

878
01:31:47,092 --> 01:31:48,927
Brego.

879
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:06,069
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

880
01:32:06,236 --> 01:32:09,531
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

881
01:32:10,574 --> 01:32:12,993
You speak as one of their own.

882
01:32:14,786 --> 01:32:17,247
I was raised in Rivendell...

883
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:19,041
...for a time.

884
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:24,379
Turn this fellow free.

885
01:32:25,005 --> 01:32:27,507
He's seen enough of war.

886
01:32:39,269 --> 01:32:42,105
Gandalf the White.

887
01:32:42,272 --> 01:32:44,649
Gandalf the Fool!

888
01:32:45,984 --> 01:32:50,238
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

889
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:55,160
There were three
who followed the wizard.

890
01:32:55,577 --> 01:33:00,916
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

891
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:04,086
You stink of horse.

892
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:11,218
The Man...

893
01:33:13,261 --> 01:33:17,474
- ...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

894
01:33:17,641 --> 01:33:21,436
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

895
01:33:21,603 --> 01:33:23,396
His cloth was poor.

896
01:33:24,314 --> 01:33:29,444
And yet he bore a strange ring.

897
01:33:30,529 --> 01:33:34,074
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

898
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:40,080
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

899
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:42,165
The Ring of Barahir.

900
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:46,711
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

901
01:33:46,878 --> 01:33:50,215
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

902
01:33:50,382 --> 01:33:53,135
The line was broken years ago.

903
01:33:54,553 --> 01:33:56,012
It matters not.

904
01:33:56,179 --> 01:33:58,723
The world of Men shall fall.

905
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,767
It will begin at Edoras.

906
01:34:09,985 --> 01:34:11,903
I am ready, Gamling.

907
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:14,573
Bring my horse.

908
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:19,077
This is not a defeat.

909
01:34:21,496 --> 01:34:22,706
We will return.

910
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:30,589
We will return.

911
01:34:53,945 --> 01:34:55,906
You have some skill with a blade.

912
01:35:04,414 --> 01:35:06,499
Women of this country learned long ago:

913
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:09,294
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

914
01:35:09,461 --> 01:35:11,296
I fear neither death nor pain.

915
01:35:12,547 --> 01:35:14,674
What do you fear, my lady?

916
01:35:18,053 --> 01:35:19,888
A cage.

917
01:35:21,181 --> 01:35:25,018
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

918
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:29,147
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

919
01:35:32,525 --> 01:35:34,569
You're a daughter of kings...

920
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:39,157
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

921
01:35:44,412 --> 01:35:46,957
I do not think that would be your fate.

922
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:23,034
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

923
01:36:23,201 --> 01:36:25,328
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

924
01:36:25,495 --> 01:36:28,373
He will expect an attack on the city.

925
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:32,961
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

926
01:36:33,128 --> 01:36:35,463
...the great fortress of Rohan.

927
01:36:36,715 --> 01:36:41,052
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

928
01:36:42,512 --> 01:36:44,222
<i>They will be slow.</i>

929
01:36:44,597 --> 01:36:49,019
They will have women and children
with them.

930
01:36:52,897 --> 01:36:55,233
Send out your Warg-riders.

931
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,959
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

932
01:37:13,126 --> 01:37:15,795
- Why do you do that?
- What?

933
01:37:15,962 --> 01:37:18,506
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

934
01:37:18,923 --> 01:37:20,967
Because.

935
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:24,637
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

936
01:37:24,804 --> 01:37:27,015
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

937
01:37:27,432 --> 01:37:30,226
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

938
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:32,645
You have no idea what it did to him...

939
01:37:32,812 --> 01:37:35,315
...what it's still doing to him.

940
01:37:37,525 --> 01:37:39,611
I want to help him, Sam.

941
01:37:39,778 --> 01:37:41,071
Why?

942
01:37:46,368 --> 01:37:49,496
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

943
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:55,668
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

944
01:37:55,835 --> 01:37:58,588
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

945
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:09,724
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.

946
01:38:10,558 --> 01:38:11,684
I do.

947
01:38:13,728 --> 01:38:15,605
It's the Ring.

948
01:38:16,147 --> 01:38:17,732
You can't take your eyes off it.

949
01:38:18,441 --> 01:38:20,443
I've seen you.

950
01:38:20,902 --> 01:38:24,739
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.

951
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:28,743
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

952
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:31,621
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

953
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:34,707
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

954
01:38:34,874 --> 01:38:36,626
Mine! My own!

955
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,587
Can't you hear yourself?

956
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:41,423
Don't you know who you sound like?

957
01:38:51,683 --> 01:38:53,810
We wants it.

958
01:38:53,977 --> 01:38:56,688
We needs it.

959
01:38:56,855 --> 01:39:01,651
Must have the precious.

960
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,280
They stole it from us.

961
01:39:05,447 --> 01:39:08,825
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

962
01:39:08,992 --> 01:39:12,871
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

963
01:39:13,037 --> 01:39:16,332
No. Not master.

964
01:39:16,499 --> 01:39:20,336
Yes, precious. False.

965
01:39:20,503 --> 01:39:25,008
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

966
01:39:26,134 --> 01:39:28,595
Master's my friend.

967
01:39:28,761 --> 01:39:33,892
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

968
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:37,604
Not listening.
I'm not listening.

969
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:41,774
You're a liar and a thief.

970
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,985
No.

971
01:39:44,903 --> 01:39:47,780
Murderer.

972
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:51,284
Go away.

973
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:53,828
Go away?

974
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:58,625
I hate you.

975
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:01,211
I hate you.

976
01:40:01,503 --> 01:40:04,797
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

977
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:06,799
I saved us.

978
01:40:06,966 --> 01:40:11,513
It was me.
We survived because of me.

979
01:40:12,722 --> 01:40:16,309
Not anymore.

980
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:19,229
What did you say?

981
01:40:21,272 --> 01:40:25,109
Master looks after us now.

982
01:40:25,276 --> 01:40:28,780
We don't need you.

983
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:31,074
What?

984
01:40:31,241 --> 01:40:32,992
Leave now...

985
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:36,955
...and never come back.

986
01:40:37,121 --> 01:40:38,164
No.

987
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:42,877
Leave now and never come back.

988
01:40:45,463 --> 01:40:51,386
Leave now and never come back!

989
01:41:03,356 --> 01:41:06,067
We told him to go away.

990
01:41:06,234 --> 01:41:09,195
And away he goes, precious.

991
01:41:09,362 --> 01:41:11,364
Gone! Gone! Gone!

992
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:13,324
Sméagol is free!

993
01:41:18,246 --> 01:41:19,747
Look.

994
01:41:19,914 --> 01:41:24,419
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

995
01:41:33,928 --> 01:41:35,346
They are young.

996
01:41:35,513 --> 01:41:38,057
They are tender.
They are nice.

997
01:41:38,224 --> 01:41:41,769
Yes, they are.
Eat them. Eat them!

998
01:41:44,522 --> 01:41:46,065
You'll make him sick, you will...

999
01:41:47,275 --> 01:41:49,527
...behaving like that.

1000
01:41:51,863 --> 01:41:54,657
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1001
01:41:58,828 --> 01:42:00,413
What's it doing?

1002
01:42:01,122 --> 01:42:03,791
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1003
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:06,169
It ruins it.

1004
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:09,964
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.

1005
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:16,679
What we need is a few good taters.

1006
01:42:17,555 --> 01:42:20,600
What's taters, precious?

1007
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,518
What's taters? Eh?

1008
01:42:22,685 --> 01:42:24,395
Po-ta-toes.

1009
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:27,982
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1010
01:42:29,484 --> 01:42:34,989
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1011
01:42:36,282 --> 01:42:38,201
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1012
01:42:38,576 --> 01:42:40,703
Oh, yes, we could.

1013
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:44,374
Spoil a nice fish.

1014
01:42:45,667 --> 01:42:48,294
Give it to us raw...

1015
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:51,506
...and wriggling.

1016
01:42:51,673 --> 01:42:54,801
You keep nasty chips.

1017
01:42:55,718 --> 01:42:57,804
You're hopeless.

1018
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:11,818
Mr. Frodo?

1019
01:43:29,711 --> 01:43:32,380
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1020
01:43:32,547 --> 01:43:35,007
Servants of Sauron.

1021
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,010
They are called to Mordor.

1022
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:41,222
The Dark One is gathering
all armies to him.

1023
01:43:41,389 --> 01:43:44,559
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1024
01:43:46,144 --> 01:43:49,772
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1025
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:55,153
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1026
01:43:55,403 --> 01:43:57,238
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.

1027
01:43:58,656 --> 01:43:59,866
Mr. Frodo.

1028
01:44:00,366 --> 01:44:01,993
Look.

1029
01:44:05,663 --> 01:44:07,957
It's an oliphaunt.

1030
01:44:16,174 --> 01:44:19,177
No one at home will believe this.

1031
01:44:30,313 --> 01:44:32,190
Sméagol?

1032
01:45:12,522 --> 01:45:15,024
We've lingered here too long.

1033
01:45:18,027 --> 01:45:19,362
Come on, Sam.

1034
01:45:31,415 --> 01:45:32,667
No!

1035
01:45:32,834 --> 01:45:35,503
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1036
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:42,343
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1037
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:45,388
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1038
01:45:46,764 --> 01:45:50,142
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1039
01:45:50,309 --> 01:45:52,395
The enemy?

1040
01:45:54,438 --> 01:45:57,942
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1041
01:46:00,403 --> 01:46:02,530
You wonder what his name is...

1042
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:06,284
...where he came from.

1043
01:46:08,286 --> 01:46:10,705
And if he was really evil at heart.

1044
01:46:12,373 --> 01:46:15,835
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1045
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,922
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1046
01:46:22,091 --> 01:46:23,634
...in peace.

1047
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:30,224
War will make corpses of us all.

1048
01:46:30,391 --> 01:46:32,435
Bind their hands.

1049
01:46:46,267 --> 01:46:49,019
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1050
01:46:49,228 --> 01:46:52,856
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1051
01:46:53,023 --> 01:46:56,235
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1052
01:46:56,568 --> 01:46:58,487
It's the beards.

1053
01:46:58,737 --> 01:47:00,823
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1054
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,867
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1055
01:47:04,034 --> 01:47:08,289
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1056
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:11,357
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1057
01:47:17,923 --> 01:47:20,259
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1058
01:47:20,634 --> 01:47:22,636
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1059
01:47:24,555 --> 01:47:28,392
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1060
01:47:28,684 --> 01:47:31,437
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1061
01:47:31,603 --> 01:47:33,897
Cut down by Orcs.

1062
01:47:34,064 --> 01:47:37,067
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1063
01:47:37,693 --> 01:47:42,406
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1064
01:47:42,573 --> 01:47:47,119
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1065
01:47:57,087 --> 01:47:59,465
Gimli.

1066
01:47:59,631 --> 01:48:01,717
No, I couldn't.

1067
01:48:01,884 --> 01:48:03,719
I really couldn't.

1068
01:48:08,223 --> 01:48:09,850
I made some stew.

1069
01:48:10,017 --> 01:48:13,312
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1070
01:48:21,111 --> 01:48:23,155
Thank you.

1071
01:48:43,675 --> 01:48:46,220
- It's good.
- Really?

1072
01:48:50,182 --> 01:48:53,560
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1073
01:48:54,853 --> 01:48:58,941
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1074
01:48:59,358 --> 01:49:01,860
But he must be mistaken.

1075
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:06,490
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1076
01:49:07,616 --> 01:49:10,869
Then you must be at least 60.

1077
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:14,498
Seventy?

1078
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:16,583
But you cannot be 80!

1079
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,296
Eighty-seven.

1080
01:49:24,383 --> 01:49:26,510
You are one of the Dúnedain.

1081
01:49:27,553 --> 01:49:30,681
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

1082
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:34,518
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1083
01:49:35,185 --> 01:49:36,937
There are few of us left.

1084
01:49:37,104 --> 01:49:39,940
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1085
01:49:40,691 --> 01:49:44,111
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1086
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:02,921
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

1087
01:50:03,672 --> 01:50:07,134
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

1088
01:50:08,927 --> 01:50:11,346
<i>Like my heart.</i>

1089
01:50:12,764 --> 01:50:15,476
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1090
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:18,145
I am asleep.

1091
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:26,570
This is a dream.

1092
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:31,992
Then it is a good dream.

1093
01:50:44,004 --> 01:50:46,089
Sleep.

1094
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:50,988
Arwen...

1095
01:52:40,454 --> 01:52:42,289
Where is she?

1096
01:52:43,457 --> 01:52:45,876
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1097
01:52:49,212 --> 01:52:51,965
<i>Our time here is ending.</i>

1098
01:52:52,633 --> 01:52:55,218
Arwen's time is ending.

1099
01:52:55,927 --> 01:52:57,220
Let her go.

1100
01:52:57,387 --> 01:52:59,389
Let her take the ship into the west.

1101
01:52:59,556 --> 01:53:02,643
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1102
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:04,603
There it will be ever green.

1103
01:53:06,104 --> 01:53:08,482
But never more than memory.

1104
01:53:09,733 --> 01:53:12,778
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1105
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:16,615
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1106
01:53:16,782 --> 01:53:19,117
She belongs with her people.

1107
01:54:07,416 --> 01:54:09,251
Why are you saying this?

1108
01:54:10,836 --> 01:54:14,005
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.

1109
01:54:15,465 --> 01:54:18,135
It was a dream, Arwen.

1110
01:54:18,552 --> 01:54:19,928
Nothing more.

1111
01:54:21,304 --> 01:54:24,516
I don't believe you.

1112
01:54:33,525 --> 01:54:35,360
This belongs to you.

1113
01:54:38,113 --> 01:54:39,698
It was a gift.

1114
01:54:42,367 --> 01:54:43,869
Keep it.

1115
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:47,581
My lord?

1116
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:54,963
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1117
01:55:18,403 --> 01:55:19,905
What is it?

1118
01:55:21,406 --> 01:55:23,450
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

1119
01:55:40,008 --> 01:55:42,093
Wargs!

1120
01:55:54,606 --> 01:55:56,274
A scout!

1121
01:56:02,614 --> 01:56:05,116
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1122
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:08,662
Get them out of here!

1123
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:15,460
All riders to the head of the column.

1124
01:56:16,127 --> 01:56:18,129
Come on. Get me up here.
I'm a rider.

1125
01:56:18,296 --> 01:56:20,048
Come on!

1126
01:56:31,852 --> 01:56:34,312
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1127
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:35,981
- I can fight.
- No!

1128
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:40,735
You must do this, for me.

1129
01:56:42,737 --> 01:56:44,322
Follow me! Hyah!

1130
01:56:47,826 --> 01:56:52,163
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1131
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:55,000
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1132
01:58:07,238 --> 01:58:09,532
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1133
01:58:12,327 --> 01:58:13,912
That one counts as mine!

1134
01:58:30,595 --> 01:58:32,222
Stinking creature.

1135
01:59:59,476 --> 02:00:01,352
Aragorn!

1136
02:00:06,066 --> 02:00:07,525
Aragorn?

1137
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:24,459
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1138
02:00:24,626 --> 02:00:26,044
He's...

1139
02:00:26,628 --> 02:00:28,213
...dead.

1140
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,758
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1141
02:00:35,386 --> 02:00:36,679
You lie.

1142
02:01:10,588 --> 02:01:12,215
Get the wounded on horses.

1143
02:01:13,508 --> 02:01:16,678
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1144
02:01:17,095 --> 02:01:19,222
Leave the dead.

1145
02:01:26,604 --> 02:01:28,106
Come.

1146
02:01:38,283 --> 02:01:39,909
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1147
02:01:40,076 --> 02:01:42,954
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1148
02:01:45,498 --> 02:01:47,333
We're safe!

1149
02:01:48,835 --> 02:01:51,713
We're safe, my lady.

1150
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,089
Thank you.

1151
02:02:37,425 --> 02:02:38,843
- Mama!
- Éothain!

1152
02:02:39,010 --> 02:02:40,553
Freda!

1153
02:02:46,309 --> 02:02:49,145
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1154
02:02:52,982 --> 02:02:54,317
Take it to the caves.

1155
02:02:54,484 --> 02:02:57,320
Make way for the king.

1156
02:02:59,197 --> 02:03:02,158
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1157
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:13,795
So few.
So few of you have returned.

1158
02:03:16,547 --> 02:03:18,841
Our people are safe.

1159
02:03:20,176 --> 02:03:22,720
We have paid for it with many lives.

1160
02:03:23,554 --> 02:03:25,098
My lady.

1161
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:31,062
Lord Aragorn...

1162
02:03:31,229 --> 02:03:32,480
...where is he?

1163
02:03:34,482 --> 02:03:36,025
He fell.

1164
02:03:58,715 --> 02:04:01,676
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1165
02:04:01,843 --> 02:04:04,762
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1166
02:04:05,013 --> 02:04:08,099
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1167
02:04:08,266 --> 02:04:10,893
Get them into the caves.

1168
02:04:11,769 --> 02:04:16,607
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1169
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:22,071
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.</i>

1170
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:24,574
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

1171
02:04:24,741 --> 02:04:27,827
<i>...but for a small culvert
at its base...</i>

1172
02:04:27,994 --> 02:04:30,788
<i>...which is little more than a drain.</i>

1173
02:04:33,624 --> 02:04:37,795
How? How can fire undo stone?

1174
02:04:37,962 --> 02:04:42,508
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1175
02:04:46,137 --> 02:04:50,141
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1176
02:04:50,308 --> 02:04:53,811
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1177
02:04:53,978 --> 02:04:56,564
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1178
02:04:56,731 --> 02:04:58,149
Tens of thousands.

1179
02:04:58,316 --> 02:05:02,403
But, my lord,
there is no such force.

1180
02:05:14,332 --> 02:05:17,418
A new power is rising.

1181
02:05:17,585 --> 02:05:20,588
Its victory is at hand.

1182
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:28,346
This night...

1183
02:05:28,763 --> 02:05:33,101
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1184
02:05:33,267 --> 02:05:36,604
March to Helm's Deep!

1185
02:05:36,771 --> 02:05:40,274
Leave none alive!

1186
02:05:42,777 --> 02:05:45,279
To war!

1187
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:53,663
There will be no dawn for Men.

1188
02:06:10,847 --> 02:06:12,890
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1189
02:06:13,057 --> 02:06:16,227
There is always smoke rising...

1190
02:06:16,436 --> 02:06:20,273
...from Isengard these days.

1191
02:06:20,523 --> 02:06:22,108
Isengard?

1192
02:06:22,316 --> 02:06:24,193
There was a time...

1193
02:06:24,527 --> 02:06:28,072
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1194
02:06:28,239 --> 02:06:31,576
But now he has a mind of metal...

1195
02:06:32,243 --> 02:06:34,704
...and wheels.

1196
02:06:35,455 --> 02:06:39,959
He no longer cares for growing things.

1197
02:06:40,126 --> 02:06:41,919
What is it?

1198
02:06:46,924 --> 02:06:49,135
It's Saruman's army.

1199
02:06:49,302 --> 02:06:50,887
The war has started.

1200
02:07:29,175 --> 02:07:33,554
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

1201
02:08:05,836 --> 02:08:07,713
Brego.

1202
02:08:33,823 --> 02:08:34,991
Arwen.

1203
02:08:44,875 --> 02:08:46,669
I have made my choice.

1204
02:08:53,092 --> 02:08:55,970
He is not coming back.

1205
02:08:57,388 --> 02:09:00,725
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1206
02:09:01,642 --> 02:09:04,645
There is still hope.

1207
02:09:08,774 --> 02:09:12,570
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1208
02:09:15,948 --> 02:09:18,909
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1209
02:09:19,076 --> 02:09:21,579
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

1210
02:09:21,746 --> 02:09:26,459
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1211
02:09:26,751 --> 02:09:29,754
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1212
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,840
...Aragorn will die.

1213
02:09:35,676 --> 02:09:38,262
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

1214
02:09:38,429 --> 02:09:42,642
<i>...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

1215
02:09:45,436 --> 02:09:48,189
<i>He will come to death...</i>

1216
02:09:48,356 --> 02:09:50,941
<i>...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

1217
02:09:51,108 --> 02:09:55,780
<i>...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

1218
02:10:04,872 --> 02:10:08,834
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

1219
02:10:09,627 --> 02:10:14,674
<i>...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

1220
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:18,928
<i>...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

1221
02:10:21,305 --> 02:10:23,724
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

1222
02:10:23,891 --> 02:10:28,813
<i>...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

1223
02:10:30,523 --> 02:10:32,525
<i>...until all the world is changed...</i>

1224
02:10:32,692 --> 02:10:37,196
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1225
02:10:45,746 --> 02:10:46,914
Arwen.

1226
02:10:53,546 --> 02:10:55,840
There is nothing for you here...

1227
02:10:56,507 --> 02:10:58,592
...only death.

1228
02:12:32,019 --> 02:12:35,648
<i>The power of the enemy is growing.</i>

1229
02:12:35,815 --> 02:12:38,442
<i>Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...</i>

1230
02:12:38,609 --> 02:12:42,071
<i>...to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

1231
02:12:44,114 --> 02:12:47,785
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

1232
02:12:52,081 --> 02:12:55,459
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

1233
02:12:56,585 --> 02:12:59,588
<i>...the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

1234
02:12:59,755 --> 02:13:04,134
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

1235
02:13:07,847 --> 02:13:10,975
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

1236
02:13:11,141 --> 02:13:14,603
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

1237
02:13:14,770 --> 02:13:18,816
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

1238
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:24,238
...the quest will claim his life.

1239
02:13:24,405 --> 02:13:26,574
You know this.

1240
02:13:27,157 --> 02:13:29,994
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

1241
02:13:32,121 --> 02:13:35,583
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

1242
02:13:39,962 --> 02:13:44,174
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

1243
02:13:45,342 --> 02:13:49,763
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

1244
02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:55,394
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

1245
02:13:55,603 --> 02:13:59,189
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

1246
02:13:59,356 --> 02:14:03,444
<i>...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

1247
02:14:05,863 --> 02:14:07,698
<i>It is close now.</i>

1248
02:14:07,865 --> 02:14:12,119
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

1249
02:14:15,205 --> 02:14:18,876
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

1250
02:14:19,043 --> 02:14:23,172
<i>...even unto the ending
of the world.</i>

1251
02:14:25,007 --> 02:14:26,842
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

1252
02:14:27,051 --> 02:14:28,969
<i>...is over.</i>

1253
02:14:29,803 --> 02:14:33,390
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

1254
02:14:35,351 --> 02:14:38,604
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

1255
02:14:43,233 --> 02:14:44,568
What news?

1256
02:14:44,735 --> 02:14:47,571
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1257
02:14:47,738 --> 02:14:50,574
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1258
02:14:50,741 --> 02:14:54,787
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1259
02:14:54,954 --> 02:14:57,373
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1260
02:14:57,706 --> 02:14:59,833
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1261
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,420
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1262
02:15:04,505 --> 02:15:08,092
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1263
02:15:08,258 --> 02:15:11,303
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1264
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:15,599
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1265
02:15:15,766 --> 02:15:18,477
Sauron from Mordor.

1266
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:23,023
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1267
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:24,900
Gondor is weak.

1268
02:15:25,067 --> 02:15:28,195
Sauron will strike us soon.

1269
02:15:28,946 --> 02:15:30,781
And he will strike hard.

1270
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:35,327
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1271
02:15:49,258 --> 02:15:51,468
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1272
02:15:51,635 --> 02:15:54,388
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1273
02:15:54,555 --> 02:15:56,807
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1274
02:16:03,689 --> 02:16:05,441
Speak.

1275
02:16:06,525 --> 02:16:09,153
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1276
02:16:09,486 --> 02:16:12,489
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1277
02:16:12,906 --> 02:16:14,450
Your bodyguard?

1278
02:16:14,616 --> 02:16:16,410
His gardener.

1279
02:16:16,994 --> 02:16:18,996
And where is your skulking friend?

1280
02:16:20,497 --> 02:16:22,833
That gangrel creature.

1281
02:16:23,167 --> 02:16:25,127
He had an ill-favored look.

1282
02:16:26,837 --> 02:16:28,756
There was no other.

1283
02:16:32,843 --> 02:16:35,179
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1284
02:16:38,515 --> 02:16:41,602
One we lost in Moria...

1285
02:16:42,686 --> 02:16:44,188
...two were my kin...

1286
02:16:44,354 --> 02:16:48,108
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1287
02:16:48,275 --> 02:16:52,196
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1288
02:16:57,201 --> 02:16:58,952
You're a friend of Boromir?

1289
02:17:01,371 --> 02:17:02,873
Yes.

1290
02:17:03,957 --> 02:17:05,042
For my part.

1291
02:17:11,548 --> 02:17:14,510
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1292
02:17:16,553 --> 02:17:18,013
Dead?

1293
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:20,224
How? When?

1294
02:17:20,474 --> 02:17:23,143
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1295
02:17:23,435 --> 02:17:27,272
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1296
02:17:30,025 --> 02:17:36,490
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1297
02:17:36,698 --> 02:17:39,785
It was cloven in two.

1298
02:17:41,453 --> 02:17:44,873
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1299
02:17:46,917 --> 02:17:48,710
He was my brother.

1300
02:18:37,593 --> 02:18:40,637
Boromir!

1301
02:18:41,138 --> 02:18:43,015
Boromir!

1302
02:18:47,269 --> 02:18:51,023
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1303
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:54,860
A place of light and beauty and music.

1304
02:18:55,027 --> 02:18:57,362
And so it shall be once more!

1305
02:18:59,907 --> 02:19:02,576
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1306
02:19:02,743 --> 02:19:07,122
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1307
02:19:10,918 --> 02:19:16,590
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1308
02:19:16,965 --> 02:19:18,926
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1309
02:19:19,092 --> 02:19:21,929
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1310
02:19:30,646 --> 02:19:33,398
Good speech. Nice and short.

1311
02:19:33,565 --> 02:19:36,485
Leaves more time for drinking!

1312
02:19:36,777 --> 02:19:41,031
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!

1313
02:19:44,493 --> 02:19:46,662
Remember today, little brother.

1314
02:19:46,828 --> 02:19:49,831
Today, life is good.

1315
02:19:54,002 --> 02:19:55,587
What?

1316
02:19:55,963 --> 02:19:57,422
He's here.

1317
02:20:00,634 --> 02:20:03,679
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?

1318
02:20:03,845 --> 02:20:07,307
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1319
02:20:07,849 --> 02:20:09,559
Father!

1320
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:16,775
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1321
02:20:16,942 --> 02:20:20,362
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1322
02:20:21,822 --> 02:20:24,741
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1323
02:20:25,534 --> 02:20:27,828
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1324
02:20:27,995 --> 02:20:30,038
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1325
02:20:30,205 --> 02:20:31,915
Oh, too few.

1326
02:20:32,416 --> 02:20:34,793
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1327
02:20:37,004 --> 02:20:40,090
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1328
02:20:40,257 --> 02:20:42,509
That is not my intent.

1329
02:20:42,676 --> 02:20:46,430
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1330
02:20:49,808 --> 02:20:52,728
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1331
02:20:52,894 --> 02:20:55,647
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1332
02:20:55,814 --> 02:20:59,443
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1333
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:03,030
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1334
02:21:03,196 --> 02:21:06,074
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1335
02:21:06,241 --> 02:21:10,037
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1336
02:21:12,247 --> 02:21:14,541
The One Ring.

1337
02:21:17,294 --> 02:21:21,965
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1338
02:21:22,132 --> 02:21:25,761
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1339
02:21:25,927 --> 02:21:30,057
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1340
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:34,519
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1341
02:21:34,686 --> 02:21:38,398
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1342
02:21:38,565 --> 02:21:42,527
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1343
02:21:42,694 --> 02:21:47,991
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1344
02:21:48,158 --> 02:21:53,246
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1345
02:21:53,413 --> 02:21:54,915
He will return.

1346
02:21:55,082 --> 02:21:58,835
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1347
02:21:59,002 --> 02:22:01,546
You must go.

1348
02:22:02,714 --> 02:22:04,841
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1349
02:22:05,675 --> 02:22:11,181
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1350
02:22:11,348 --> 02:22:15,018
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1351
02:22:15,185 --> 02:22:18,188
- ...send me in his stead.
- You?

1352
02:22:19,356 --> 02:22:21,274
Oh, I see.

1353
02:22:21,441 --> 02:22:25,654
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1354
02:22:26,071 --> 02:22:28,073
I think not.

1355
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,118
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1356
02:22:31,284 --> 02:22:34,204
The one who will not fail me.

1357
02:22:51,346 --> 02:22:54,516
Remember today, little brother.

1358
02:23:12,868 --> 02:23:14,870
Captain Faramir!

1359
02:23:16,121 --> 02:23:18,248
We found the third one.

1360
02:23:29,759 --> 02:23:31,761
You must come with me. Now.

1361
02:23:42,981 --> 02:23:44,107
Down there.

1362
02:23:58,997 --> 02:24:01,875
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1363
02:24:12,469 --> 02:24:13,970
They wait for my command.

1364
02:24:19,476 --> 02:24:20,560
Shall I shoot?

1365
02:24:21,811 --> 02:24:24,814
<i>The rock and pool
Is nice and cool</i>

1366
02:24:24,981 --> 02:24:26,816
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1367
02:24:27,484 --> 02:24:30,445
<i>Our only wish
To catch a fish</i>

1368
02:24:30,612 --> 02:24:33,323
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1369
02:24:40,330 --> 02:24:41,706
Wait.

1370
02:24:43,208 --> 02:24:46,044
This creature is bound to me.

1371
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:48,588
And I to him.

1372
02:24:51,841 --> 02:24:53,176
He is our guide.

1373
02:24:57,889 --> 02:24:59,307
Please...

1374
02:24:59,474 --> 02:25:01,351
...let me go down to him.

1375
02:25:12,612 --> 02:25:14,281
Sméagol.

1376
02:25:15,282 --> 02:25:17,534
Master is here.

1377
02:25:18,702 --> 02:25:19,869
Come, Sméagol.

1378
02:25:22,706 --> 02:25:25,375
Trust master. Come.

1379
02:25:28,545 --> 02:25:32,382
We must go now?

1380
02:25:32,716 --> 02:25:36,177
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1381
02:25:36,344 --> 02:25:37,721
Follow me. Come on.

1382
02:25:38,930 --> 02:25:40,557
Come.

1383
02:25:43,059 --> 02:25:44,227
Come, Sméagol.

1384
02:25:44,728 --> 02:25:46,813
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1385
02:25:47,314 --> 02:25:48,857
Come on.

1386
02:25:53,236 --> 02:25:54,904
Don't hurt him!

1387
02:25:55,071 --> 02:25:57,824
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1388
02:25:57,991 --> 02:25:59,284
Master!

1389
02:26:24,476 --> 02:26:26,853
That's enough.

1390
02:26:30,482 --> 02:26:32,651
Where are you leading them?

1391
02:26:34,444 --> 02:26:36,112
Answer me.

1392
02:26:36,946 --> 02:26:40,158
Sméagol.

1393
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:48,375
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1394
02:26:49,626 --> 02:26:52,253
Cruel Men hurts us.

1395
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:55,423
Master tricksed us.

1396
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:59,135
Of course he did.

1397
02:26:59,511 --> 02:27:03,223
I told you he was tricksy.

1398
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:06,434
I told you he was false.

1399
02:27:06,601 --> 02:27:09,312
Master is our friend.

1400
02:27:09,479 --> 02:27:11,815
Our friend.

1401
02:27:11,981 --> 02:27:14,150
Master betrayed us.

1402
02:27:14,317 --> 02:27:17,320
No. Not its business.

1403
02:27:18,405 --> 02:27:20,824
Leave us alone!

1404
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:23,410
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1405
02:27:23,576 --> 02:27:25,870
They stole it from us!

1406
02:27:26,037 --> 02:27:27,497
No. No.

1407
02:27:28,039 --> 02:27:29,666
What did they steal?

1408
02:27:31,835 --> 02:27:37,173
My precious!

1409
02:27:40,844 --> 02:27:42,512
We have to get out of here.

1410
02:27:43,096 --> 02:27:45,056
You go. Go, now.

1411
02:27:47,684 --> 02:27:49,519
You can do it.

1412
02:27:50,979 --> 02:27:52,439
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1413
02:27:52,605 --> 02:27:54,399
Just this once.

1414
02:27:54,566 --> 02:27:56,359
Put it on.

1415
02:27:56,776 --> 02:27:58,820
Disappear.

1416
02:27:59,863 --> 02:28:00,947
I can't.

1417
02:28:04,033 --> 02:28:06,244
You were right, Sam.

1418
02:28:07,704 --> 02:28:10,206
You tried to tell me but...

1419
02:28:14,878 --> 02:28:17,046
I'm sorry.

1420
02:28:21,593 --> 02:28:24,471
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1421
02:28:25,889 --> 02:28:27,557
If I put it on...

1422
02:28:27,724 --> 02:28:30,059
...he'll find me.

1423
02:28:31,728 --> 02:28:33,688
He'll see.

1424
02:28:34,898 --> 02:28:36,900
Mr. Frodo...

1425
02:28:41,821 --> 02:28:46,075
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1426
02:28:48,286 --> 02:28:51,289
Here in the Wild I have you...

1427
02:28:51,456 --> 02:28:53,374
...two Halflings...

1428
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:56,711
...and a host of men at my call.

1429
02:29:00,006 --> 02:29:03,510
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1430
02:29:13,186 --> 02:29:16,940
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1431
02:29:18,525 --> 02:29:21,569
...to show his quality.

1432
02:29:42,674 --> 02:29:44,300
No!

1433
02:29:47,470 --> 02:29:48,805
Stop it!

1434
02:29:48,972 --> 02:29:50,014
Leave him alone.

1435
02:29:51,349 --> 02:29:53,852
Don't you understand?

1436
02:29:55,144 --> 02:29:57,063
He's got to destroy it!

1437
02:29:57,230 --> 02:30:00,483
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1438
02:30:00,650 --> 02:30:02,318
To the Mountain of Fire!

1439
02:30:03,361 --> 02:30:06,489
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1440
02:30:06,656 --> 02:30:09,659
Please. It's such a burden.

1441
02:30:11,828 --> 02:30:13,913
Will you not help him?

1442
02:30:15,248 --> 02:30:17,166
Captain?

1443
02:30:17,834 --> 02:30:20,044
Prepare to leave.

1444
02:30:25,008 --> 02:30:27,427
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1445
02:31:40,416 --> 02:31:43,086
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1446
02:31:43,252 --> 02:31:46,297
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1447
02:31:46,464 --> 02:31:50,259
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1448
02:31:50,426 --> 02:31:54,430
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1449
02:31:55,098 --> 02:31:56,599
Bless you, laddie.

1450
02:31:57,183 --> 02:31:58,935
Gimli, where is the king?

1451
02:32:12,699 --> 02:32:14,033
You look terrible.

1452
02:32:55,783 --> 02:32:57,827
A great host, you say?

1453
02:32:57,994 --> 02:32:59,454
All Isengard is emptied.

1454
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:00,663
How many?

1455
02:33:01,330 --> 02:33:04,333
Ten thousand strong at least.

1456
02:33:05,877 --> 02:33:07,336
Ten thousand?

1457
02:33:07,754 --> 02:33:10,256
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1458
02:33:12,925 --> 02:33:15,053
To destroy the world of Men.

1459
02:33:17,555 --> 02:33:19,557
They will be here by nightfall.

1460
02:33:25,396 --> 02:33:26,689
Let them come!

1461
02:33:28,191 --> 02:33:30,985
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1462
02:33:31,152 --> 02:33:34,280
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1463
02:33:42,538 --> 02:33:45,458
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1464
02:33:45,625 --> 02:33:48,044
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1465
02:33:48,211 --> 02:33:50,963
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1466
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:53,549
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1467
02:33:54,133 --> 02:33:56,344
These are Uruk-hai.

1468
02:33:56,511 --> 02:33:59,931
Their Armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1469
02:34:01,557 --> 02:34:05,228
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1470
02:34:05,394 --> 02:34:09,023
I know how to defend my own keep.

1471
02:34:15,613 --> 02:34:19,033
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1472
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:24,413
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1473
02:34:24,622 --> 02:34:27,291
Crops can be resown...

1474
02:34:27,458 --> 02:34:30,461
...homes rebuilt.

1475
02:34:31,087 --> 02:34:33,631
Within these walls...

1476
02:34:34,006 --> 02:34:35,508
...we will outlast them.

1477
02:34:35,675 --> 02:34:38,094
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1478
02:34:38,261 --> 02:34:39,804
They come to destroy its people...

1479
02:34:39,971 --> 02:34:42,473
...down to the last child.

1480
02:34:43,349 --> 02:34:45,601
What would you have me do?

1481
02:34:45,768 --> 02:34:47,520
Look at my men.

1482
02:34:47,687 --> 02:34:49,438
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1483
02:34:51,607 --> 02:34:56,028
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1484
02:34:56,195 --> 02:34:59,240
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1485
02:35:02,869 --> 02:35:04,787
Send out riders, my lord.

1486
02:35:05,079 --> 02:35:07,957
You must call for aid.

1487
02:35:11,210 --> 02:35:13,462
And who will come?

1488
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:15,464
Elves?

1489
02:35:15,631 --> 02:35:17,717
Dwarves?

1490
02:35:18,467 --> 02:35:21,345
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1491
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:24,473
The old alliances are dead.

1492
02:35:24,891 --> 02:35:27,685
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1493
02:35:27,852 --> 02:35:30,062
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1494
02:35:31,022 --> 02:35:34,275
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1495
02:35:34,442 --> 02:35:36,360
Where was Gon--?

1496
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:40,990
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1497
02:35:42,575 --> 02:35:45,036
...we are alone.

1498
02:35:51,918 --> 02:35:53,669
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1499
02:35:53,836 --> 02:35:55,230
We need more time
to lay provisions--

1500
02:35:55,254 --> 02:35:58,758
There is no time.
War is upon us.

1501
02:35:59,008 --> 02:36:00,718
Secure the gate.

1502
02:36:05,932 --> 02:36:08,017
We Ents have not troubled...

1503
02:36:08,226 --> 02:36:11,604
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1504
02:36:12,355 --> 02:36:15,358
...for a very long time.

1505
02:36:16,609 --> 02:36:21,364
But now, something
is about to happen...

1506
02:36:21,530 --> 02:36:23,866
...that has not happened...

1507
02:36:24,075 --> 02:36:26,535
...for an age.

1508
02:36:27,745 --> 02:36:30,039
Entmoot.

1509
02:36:30,414 --> 02:36:31,457
What's that?

1510
02:36:31,874 --> 02:36:34,710
'Tis a gathering.

1511
02:36:35,878 --> 02:36:38,464
A gathering of what?

1512
02:36:56,399 --> 02:36:58,734
Beech. Oak.

1513
02:36:58,901 --> 02:37:00,820
Chestnut. Ash.

1514
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:03,072
Good. Good. Good.

1515
02:37:03,239 --> 02:37:05,574
Many have come.

1516
02:37:13,124 --> 02:37:15,918
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1517
02:37:16,085 --> 02:37:18,629
...will go to war.

1518
02:37:27,596 --> 02:37:30,641
Move back! Move to the caves!

1519
02:37:33,102 --> 02:37:35,187
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1520
02:37:35,604 --> 02:37:37,898
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1521
02:37:38,065 --> 02:37:40,359
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1522
02:37:40,526 --> 02:37:43,654
Aragorn, you must rest.

1523
02:37:43,821 --> 02:37:45,323
You're no use to us half alive.

1524
02:37:46,699 --> 02:37:47,908
Aragorn!

1525
02:37:51,287 --> 02:37:54,332
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1526
02:37:54,498 --> 02:37:56,167
That is an honorable charge.

1527
02:37:56,334 --> 02:37:59,211
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1528
02:37:59,378 --> 02:38:01,088
What renown is there in that?

1529
02:38:01,255 --> 02:38:04,967
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1530
02:38:05,217 --> 02:38:08,012
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1531
02:38:08,179 --> 02:38:13,184
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1532
02:38:13,476 --> 02:38:16,312
You do not command
the others to stay!

1533
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:20,232
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1534
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:23,611
Because they love you.

1535
02:38:30,701 --> 02:38:32,244
I'm sorry.

1536
02:39:38,144 --> 02:39:41,439
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1537
02:39:42,523 --> 02:39:44,316
These are no soldiers.

1538
02:39:46,569 --> 02:39:50,072
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1539
02:39:53,993 --> 02:39:56,912
Look at them. They're frightened.

1540
02:39:57,079 --> 02:39:58,539
I can see it in their eyes.

1541
02:40:19,477 --> 02:40:21,687
Then I shall die as one of them!

1542
02:40:28,110 --> 02:40:29,945
Let him go, lad.

1543
02:40:30,529 --> 02:40:32,448
Let him be.

1544
02:40:33,949 --> 02:40:39,455
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1545
02:40:43,709 --> 02:40:45,628
My lord?

1546
02:40:47,671 --> 02:40:50,257
Who am I, Gamling?

1547
02:40:53,636 --> 02:40:57,515
You are our king, sire.

1548
02:41:00,518 --> 02:41:03,812
And do you trust your king?

1549
02:41:05,314 --> 02:41:08,484
Your men, my lord...

1550
02:41:08,651 --> 02:41:11,487
...will follow you to whatever end.

1551
02:41:18,327 --> 02:41:20,246
To whatever end.

1552
02:41:30,089 --> 02:41:33,676
Where is the horse and the rider?

1553
02:41:33,842 --> 02:41:36,887
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1554
02:41:38,389 --> 02:41:42,851
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

1555
02:41:43,852 --> 02:41:47,064
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

1556
02:41:50,734 --> 02:41:54,530
The days have gone down in the West...

1557
02:41:55,197 --> 02:41:57,866
<i>...behind the hills...</i>

1558
02:41:59,743 --> 02:42:01,370
<i>...into Shadow.</i>

1559
02:42:09,837 --> 02:42:13,257
How did it come to this?

1560
02:42:29,565 --> 02:42:31,191
Huh?

1561
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:36,405
It's been going for hours.

1562
02:42:37,573 --> 02:42:39,992
They must have decided something
by now.

1563
02:42:40,159 --> 02:42:44,246
Decided? No.

1564
02:42:44,413 --> 02:42:49,585
We only just finished saying...

1565
02:42:50,753 --> 02:42:52,630
...good morning.

1566
02:42:53,964 --> 02:42:57,176
But it's nighttime already.

1567
02:42:57,343 --> 02:42:59,136
You can't take forever.

1568
02:43:00,137 --> 02:43:02,222
Don't be hasty.

1569
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:05,059
We're running out of time!

1570
02:43:08,103 --> 02:43:11,023
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1571
02:43:28,582 --> 02:43:29,917
Give me your sword.

1572
02:43:39,385 --> 02:43:40,594
What is your name?

1573
02:43:41,136 --> 02:43:43,472
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1574
02:43:45,641 --> 02:43:48,268
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1575
02:43:50,229 --> 02:43:52,189
They say that it is hopeless.

1576
02:44:09,998 --> 02:44:11,667
This is a good sword.

1577
02:44:13,669 --> 02:44:16,004
Haleth, son of Háma...

1578
02:44:20,342 --> 02:44:22,511
...there is always hope.

1579
02:44:45,492 --> 02:44:48,871
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1580
02:44:49,037 --> 02:44:50,581
Forgive me.

1581
02:44:50,748 --> 02:44:52,207
I was wrong to despair.

1582
02:45:01,049 --> 02:45:04,219
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1583
02:45:07,639 --> 02:45:09,725
It's a little tight across the chest.

1584
02:45:15,898 --> 02:45:17,858
That is no Orc horn.

1585
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:25,365
Send for the king.

1586
02:45:25,532 --> 02:45:29,119
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1587
02:46:00,776 --> 02:46:02,444
How is this possible?

1588
02:46:03,445 --> 02:46:07,115
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1589
02:46:07,282 --> 02:46:10,494
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1590
02:46:11,203 --> 02:46:15,457
Long ago we fought and died together.

1591
02:46:17,709 --> 02:46:20,629
We come to honor that allegiance.

1592
02:46:29,096 --> 02:46:31,014
You are most welcome.

1593
02:46:36,395 --> 02:46:40,190
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1594
02:47:13,974 --> 02:47:17,227
You could have picked a better spot.

1595
02:47:22,065 --> 02:47:26,278
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1596
02:47:32,409 --> 02:47:34,202
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1597
02:47:34,828 --> 02:47:37,331
Let's hope they last the night.

1598
02:49:18,765 --> 02:49:21,601
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1599
02:49:22,853 --> 02:49:24,646
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1600
02:50:04,144 --> 02:50:05,353
HOLD!

1601
02:50:27,834 --> 02:50:29,669
So it begins.

1602
02:50:56,530 --> 02:50:57,864
Did they hit anything?

1603
02:50:58,532 --> 02:51:00,534
Give them a volley.

1604
02:51:00,700 --> 02:51:02,828
- Fire!
- Fire!

1605
02:51:18,552 --> 02:51:20,220
Send them to me! Come on!

1606
02:51:39,781 --> 02:51:40,824
Ladders!

1607
02:51:41,032 --> 02:51:42,075
Good!

1608
02:51:48,874 --> 02:51:51,877
Swords! Swords!

1609
02:52:29,956 --> 02:52:32,083
Legolas! Two already!

1610
02:52:32,250 --> 02:52:34,377
I'm on 17!

1611
02:52:34,544 --> 02:52:37,130
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1612
02:52:43,929 --> 02:52:45,639
Nineteen!

1613
02:53:11,623 --> 02:53:13,041
Merry.

1614
02:53:17,462 --> 02:53:21,258
We have just agreed.

1615
02:53:31,268 --> 02:53:32,727
Yes?

1616
02:53:34,229 --> 02:53:38,400
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1617
02:53:39,526 --> 02:53:42,779
...and we have agreed...

1618
02:53:43,238 --> 02:53:47,284
...you are not Orcs.

1619
02:53:49,035 --> 02:53:51,162
Well, that's good news.

1620
02:53:51,329 --> 02:53:55,458
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1621
02:53:56,084 --> 02:53:59,879
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1622
02:54:00,046 --> 02:54:01,589
Hasty?

1623
02:54:02,382 --> 02:54:04,259
Our friends are out there.

1624
02:54:04,426 --> 02:54:08,596
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1625
02:54:08,930 --> 02:54:11,224
War? Yes.

1626
02:54:11,391 --> 02:54:13,268
It affects us all.

1627
02:54:13,435 --> 02:54:16,438
Tree, root and twig.

1628
02:54:17,314 --> 02:54:21,359
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1629
02:54:21,568 --> 02:54:23,486
...it takes a long time...

1630
02:54:23,653 --> 02:54:28,575
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1631
02:54:28,742 --> 02:54:32,954
...and we never say anything...

1632
02:54:33,121 --> 02:54:37,042
...unless it is worth taking...

1633
02:54:37,208 --> 02:54:41,254
...a long time to say.

1634
02:54:42,047 --> 02:54:45,342
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1635
02:54:45,508 --> 02:54:46,593
Nineteen!

1636
02:54:47,135 --> 02:54:49,012
Twenty!

1637
02:54:49,179 --> 02:54:50,847
Twenty-one!

1638
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:01,983
Causeway!

1639
02:55:10,700 --> 02:55:13,078
Is this it?

1640
02:55:13,244 --> 02:55:16,164
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1641
02:56:42,167 --> 02:56:43,543
Brace the gate!

1642
02:57:01,853 --> 02:57:04,105
Hold them! Stand firm!

1643
02:57:11,988 --> 02:57:13,323
Aragorn!

1644
02:57:17,952 --> 02:57:19,162
Gimli!

1645
02:58:07,919 --> 02:58:11,839
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1646
02:58:12,632 --> 02:58:16,636
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1647
02:58:17,470 --> 02:58:19,556
How can that be your decision?!

1648
02:58:20,223 --> 02:58:23,851
This is not our war.

1649
02:58:24,143 --> 02:58:26,354
But you're part of this world!

1650
02:58:30,483 --> 02:58:32,318
Aren't you?!

1651
02:58:36,406 --> 02:58:38,783
You must help. Please.

1652
02:58:40,076 --> 02:58:42,829
You must do something.

1653
02:58:43,121 --> 02:58:47,417
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1654
02:58:48,626 --> 02:58:52,338
But your part in this tale is over.

1655
02:58:52,505 --> 02:58:54,757
Go back to your home.

1656
02:59:04,767 --> 02:59:07,020
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1657
02:59:07,186 --> 02:59:09,063
We don't belong here, Merry.

1658
02:59:09,230 --> 02:59:11,524
It's too big for us.

1659
02:59:11,691 --> 02:59:14,360
What can we do in the end?

1660
02:59:16,654 --> 02:59:19,282
We've got the Shire.

1661
02:59:19,824 --> 02:59:22,368
Maybe we should go home.

1662
02:59:24,203 --> 02:59:27,415
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1663
02:59:27,582 --> 02:59:32,503
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1664
02:59:32,670 --> 02:59:34,255
And...

1665
02:59:36,049 --> 02:59:39,135
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1666
02:59:42,680 --> 02:59:45,600
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1667
03:00:05,119 --> 03:00:06,371
Aragorn!

1668
03:00:06,537 --> 03:00:08,915
Fall back to the Keep!

1669
03:00:09,082 --> 03:00:12,168
Get your men out of there!

1670
03:00:21,803 --> 03:00:23,471
Haldir!

1671
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:30,853
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1672
03:00:50,081 --> 03:00:51,290
Haldir!

1673
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:35,501
Brace the gate!

1674
03:01:37,712 --> 03:01:39,005
Hold them!

1675
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:44,218
To the gate.
Draw your swords!

1676
03:02:12,371 --> 03:02:14,290
Make way!

1677
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:18,920
We cannot hold much longer!

1678
03:02:24,884 --> 03:02:28,471
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1679
03:02:28,638 --> 03:02:31,224
As long as you can give me.

1680
03:02:31,390 --> 03:02:33,059
Gimli!

1681
03:02:34,519 --> 03:02:35,895
Timbers!

1682
03:02:36,062 --> 03:02:38,022
Brace the gate!

1683
03:02:52,787 --> 03:02:54,497
Come on. We can take them.

1684
03:02:55,331 --> 03:02:56,958
It's a long way.

1685
03:03:02,213 --> 03:03:03,965
Toss me.

1686
03:03:05,132 --> 03:03:06,968
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1687
03:03:07,134 --> 03:03:08,719
You'll have to toss me!

1688
03:03:14,308 --> 03:03:15,601
Don't tell the Elf.

1689
03:03:16,102 --> 03:03:17,895
Not a word.

1690
03:03:33,119 --> 03:03:34,579
Shore up the door!

1691
03:03:34,745 --> 03:03:36,831
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1692
03:03:36,998 --> 03:03:38,082
Watch our backs!

1693
03:03:42,211 --> 03:03:44,463
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1694
03:04:34,388 --> 03:04:35,806
Hold fast the gate!

1695
03:04:40,019 --> 03:04:42,980
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1696
03:04:47,693 --> 03:04:49,320
Aragorn!

1697
03:05:22,728 --> 03:05:25,189
Pull everybody back.

1698
03:05:25,564 --> 03:05:27,358
Pull them back.

1699
03:05:27,900 --> 03:05:29,360
Fall back!

1700
03:05:29,527 --> 03:05:32,029
Fall back!

1701
03:05:33,197 --> 03:05:34,782
They have broken through!

1702
03:05:34,949 --> 03:05:37,326
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1703
03:05:37,493 --> 03:05:39,745
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1704
03:05:39,912 --> 03:05:42,498
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1705
03:05:42,665 --> 03:05:44,917
Into the Keep!

1706
03:05:56,387 --> 03:06:01,350
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1707
03:06:01,517 --> 03:06:06,230
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1708
03:06:11,944 --> 03:06:13,237
Wait! Stop!

1709
03:06:14,113 --> 03:06:15,614
Stop!

1710
03:06:18,743 --> 03:06:20,453
Turn around.

1711
03:06:21,370 --> 03:06:24,081
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1712
03:06:24,248 --> 03:06:29,253
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1713
03:06:29,587 --> 03:06:32,298
Yes. Exactly.

1714
03:06:32,465 --> 03:06:35,676
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1715
03:06:35,843 --> 03:06:38,512
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1716
03:06:38,679 --> 03:06:40,681
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1717
03:06:43,309 --> 03:06:46,312
That doesn't make sense to me.

1718
03:06:46,479 --> 03:06:47,646
But then...

1719
03:06:47,813 --> 03:06:50,524
...you are very small.

1720
03:06:50,983 --> 03:06:52,777
Perhaps you're right.

1721
03:06:55,404 --> 03:06:56,947
South it is, then.

1722
03:06:58,449 --> 03:07:01,786
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1723
03:07:03,829 --> 03:07:06,582
I always like going south.

1724
03:07:06,749 --> 03:07:11,045
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1725
03:07:11,670 --> 03:07:14,131
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.

1726
03:07:14,298 --> 03:07:16,217
No, we won't.

1727
03:07:16,967 --> 03:07:19,220
Not this time.

1728
03:07:25,851 --> 03:07:26,894
Look!

1729
03:07:28,521 --> 03:07:30,981
Osgiliath burns!

1730
03:07:31,148 --> 03:07:32,566
Mordor has come.

1731
03:07:33,692 --> 03:07:36,112
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1732
03:07:37,446 --> 03:07:39,657
It has only the power to destroy.

1733
03:07:40,533 --> 03:07:41,992
Please...

1734
03:07:42,159 --> 03:07:43,786
...let me go.

1735
03:07:44,829 --> 03:07:46,413
Hurry.

1736
03:07:49,875 --> 03:07:51,293
Faramir!

1737
03:07:51,460 --> 03:07:53,796
You must let me go!

1738
03:07:54,380 --> 03:07:57,842
And those little family of field mice...

1739
03:07:58,008 --> 03:08:00,845
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1740
03:08:01,554 --> 03:08:04,890
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1741
03:08:16,068 --> 03:08:18,988
Many of these trees were my friends.

1742
03:08:19,697 --> 03:08:24,326
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1743
03:08:25,494 --> 03:08:26,704
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1744
03:08:26,871 --> 03:08:29,623
They had voices of their own.

1745
03:08:31,876 --> 03:08:34,420
Saruman.

1746
03:08:34,753 --> 03:08:37,840
A wizard should know better!

1747
03:08:52,104 --> 03:08:55,774
There is no curse in Elvish...

1748
03:08:55,941 --> 03:08:58,611
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1749
03:08:58,777 --> 03:09:01,113
...for this treachery.

1750
03:09:02,531 --> 03:09:05,367
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1751
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:11,290
Where are they going?

1752
03:09:11,790 --> 03:09:15,044
They have business with the Orcs.

1753
03:09:15,502 --> 03:09:19,798
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1754
03:09:19,965 --> 03:09:22,593
...with rock and stone.

1755
03:09:46,492 --> 03:09:47,660
Yes.

1756
03:09:48,744 --> 03:09:50,162
Come, my friends.

1757
03:09:51,497 --> 03:09:55,709
The Ents are going to war.

1758
03:09:55,876 --> 03:09:57,670
It is likely...

1759
03:09:57,836 --> 03:10:01,340
...that we go to our doom.

1760
03:10:02,758 --> 03:10:05,219
Last march...

1761
03:10:05,761 --> 03:10:07,805
...of the Ents.

1762
03:10:55,894 --> 03:10:59,648
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.

1763
03:10:59,815 --> 03:11:01,900
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1764
03:11:04,653 --> 03:11:06,113
Mr. Frodo?

1765
03:11:06,405 --> 03:11:10,534
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1766
03:11:10,701 --> 03:11:13,203
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1767
03:11:27,509 --> 03:11:28,927
Take them to my father.

1768
03:11:30,471 --> 03:11:33,474
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1769
03:11:35,893 --> 03:11:38,937
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1770
03:11:40,105 --> 03:11:42,775
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1771
03:11:43,442 --> 03:11:46,195
You want to know
why your brother died?

1772
03:11:46,695 --> 03:11:50,449
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1773
03:11:50,616 --> 03:11:52,493
He tried to kill him!

1774
03:11:52,659 --> 03:11:54,995
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1775
03:11:55,788 --> 03:11:57,623
Watch out!

1776
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:09,676
Mr. Frodo?

1777
03:12:12,304 --> 03:12:14,139
They're here.

1778
03:12:17,267 --> 03:12:19,728
They've come.

1779
03:12:22,314 --> 03:12:24,191
Nazgûl!

1780
03:12:46,338 --> 03:12:48,507
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1781
03:12:50,300 --> 03:12:52,511
Take cover!

1782
03:13:09,862 --> 03:13:11,405
The fortress is taken.

1783
03:13:12,197 --> 03:13:13,365
It is over.

1784
03:13:13,532 --> 03:13:17,494
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1785
03:13:17,661 --> 03:13:20,581
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1786
03:13:23,333 --> 03:13:24,710
They're breaking in!

1787
03:13:27,379 --> 03:13:29,882
They're past the door!

1788
03:13:33,218 --> 03:13:37,347
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1789
03:13:40,017 --> 03:13:41,935
Is there no other way?

1790
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:46,565
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1791
03:13:47,232 --> 03:13:49,443
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1792
03:13:54,323 --> 03:13:56,742
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1793
03:13:56,909 --> 03:13:59,745
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1794
03:14:01,914 --> 03:14:05,334
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1795
03:14:10,005 --> 03:14:11,423
Ride out with me.

1796
03:14:15,552 --> 03:14:17,179
Ride out and meet them.

1797
03:14:17,930 --> 03:14:20,098
For death and glory.

1798
03:14:20,265 --> 03:14:21,683
For Rohan.

1799
03:14:23,185 --> 03:14:24,645
For your people.

1800
03:14:25,395 --> 03:14:27,314
The sun is rising.

1801
03:14:31,818 --> 03:14:34,821
<i>Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.</i>

1802
03:14:34,988 --> 03:14:36,406
<i>At dawn...</i>

1803
03:14:36,573 --> 03:14:38,283
<i>...look to the east.</i>

1804
03:14:42,454 --> 03:14:44,122
Yes.

1805
03:14:46,583 --> 03:14:48,252
Yes.

1806
03:14:49,586 --> 03:14:51,964
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1807
03:14:52,130 --> 03:14:54,967
...shall sound in the Deep...

1808
03:14:55,384 --> 03:14:57,386
...one last time.

1809
03:14:57,553 --> 03:14:59,054
Yes!

1810
03:15:02,099 --> 03:15:05,894
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1811
03:15:13,652 --> 03:15:14,987
Fell deeds, awake.

1812
03:15:16,196 --> 03:15:17,322
Now for wrath...

1813
03:15:17,489 --> 03:15:20,867
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1814
03:15:27,916 --> 03:15:30,168
Forth Eorlingas!

1815
03:16:17,966 --> 03:16:19,217
Gandalf.

1816
03:16:26,475 --> 03:16:30,145
Théoden King stands alone.

1817
03:16:30,729 --> 03:16:32,898
Not alone.

1818
03:16:33,315 --> 03:16:34,441
Rohirrim!

1819
03:16:40,364 --> 03:16:41,531
Éomer.

1820
03:16:41,698 --> 03:16:44,242
To the king!

1821
03:18:01,820 --> 03:18:03,613
Yes!

1822
03:18:12,748 --> 03:18:16,042
A hit. A fine hit.

1823
03:18:40,734 --> 03:18:43,195
Break the dam!

1824
03:18:43,361 --> 03:18:46,823
Release the river!

1825
03:19:14,142 --> 03:19:16,895
Pippin! Hold on!

1826
03:19:22,150 --> 03:19:25,070
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1827
03:20:06,444 --> 03:20:08,446
What are you doing?

1828
03:20:17,038 --> 03:20:18,623
Where are you going?

1829
03:21:16,765 --> 03:21:18,099
It's me.

1830
03:21:20,602 --> 03:21:22,812
It's your Sam.

1831
03:21:27,150 --> 03:21:29,778
Don't you know your Sam?

1832
03:21:47,504 --> 03:21:50,882
I can't do this, Sam.

1833
03:21:51,758 --> 03:21:53,760
I know.

1834
03:21:54,761 --> 03:21:57,138
It's all wrong.

1835
03:21:57,889 --> 03:21:59,891
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1836
03:22:07,315 --> 03:22:09,401
But we are.

1837
03:22:15,824 --> 03:22:18,868
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1838
03:22:19,035 --> 03:22:21,413
The ones that really mattered.

1839
03:22:22,455 --> 03:22:25,458
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1840
03:22:25,625 --> 03:22:28,586
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1841
03:22:28,753 --> 03:22:31,715
...because how could the end be happy?

1842
03:22:34,259 --> 03:22:36,469
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it was...</i>

1843
03:22:36,636 --> 03:22:40,140
<i>...when so much bad had happened?</i>

1844
03:22:40,974 --> 03:22:42,892
Victory!

1845
03:22:43,059 --> 03:22:44,602
We have victory!

1846
03:22:44,769 --> 03:22:48,732
<i>But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...</i>

1847
03:22:48,898 --> 03:22:50,233
<i>...this shadow.</i>

1848
03:22:50,400 --> 03:22:52,777
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1849
03:22:52,944 --> 03:22:55,655
<i>A new day will come.</i>

1850
03:22:55,822 --> 03:22:59,784
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

1851
03:23:01,703 --> 03:23:04,080
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

1852
03:23:04,247 --> 03:23:05,999
<i>...that meant something.</i>

1853
03:23:06,166 --> 03:23:08,752
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

1854
03:23:10,128 --> 03:23:13,965
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo,
I do understand.</i>

1855
03:23:14,132 --> 03:23:15,717
<i>I know now.</i>

1856
03:23:16,551 --> 03:23:18,762
Folk in those stories...

1857
03:23:18,928 --> 03:23:23,058
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1858
03:23:23,224 --> 03:23:25,477
They kept going...

1859
03:23:26,144 --> 03:23:29,397
...because they were holding
on to something.

1860
03:23:30,982 --> 03:23:33,318
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1861
03:23:45,246 --> 03:23:49,167
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1862
03:23:49,459 --> 03:23:52,087
And it's worth fighting for.

1863
03:24:18,988 --> 03:24:23,284
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1864
03:24:24,035 --> 03:24:27,997
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1865
03:24:28,164 --> 03:24:30,375
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1866
03:24:34,712 --> 03:24:36,131
Then it is forfeit.

1867
03:24:38,883 --> 03:24:40,677
Release them.

1868
03:24:52,730 --> 03:24:54,774
Stay out of the forest!

1869
03:24:54,941 --> 03:24:56,734
Keep away from the trees!

1870
03:25:47,577 --> 03:25:49,370
Final count...

1871
03:25:49,537 --> 03:25:52,457
- ...42.
- Forty-two?

1872
03:25:52,624 --> 03:25:58,671
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1873
03:25:59,464 --> 03:26:03,134
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1874
03:26:07,263 --> 03:26:10,558
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1875
03:26:11,309 --> 03:26:13,811
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1876
03:26:13,978 --> 03:26:18,608
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1877
03:26:20,902 --> 03:26:25,615
- He doesn't look happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1878
03:26:25,865 --> 03:26:29,410
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1879
03:26:29,577 --> 03:26:32,538
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.

1880
03:26:32,705 --> 03:26:35,541
I hear the staff are very good.

1881
03:26:41,214 --> 03:26:43,591
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1882
03:26:43,758 --> 03:26:48,012
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1883
03:26:48,179 --> 03:26:49,430
I'm starving.

1884
03:26:49,597 --> 03:26:52,684
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1885
03:26:52,850 --> 03:26:55,937
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1886
03:27:19,877 --> 03:27:22,297
Saruman's storeroom!

1887
03:27:24,632 --> 03:27:27,385
I don't believe it.

1888
03:27:27,552 --> 03:27:29,595
It can't be.

1889
03:27:30,221 --> 03:27:33,099
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1890
03:27:34,392 --> 03:27:36,728
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1891
03:27:37,061 --> 03:27:40,189
It's perfect.
One barrel each.

1892
03:27:40,356 --> 03:27:41,482
Wait.

1893
03:27:42,233 --> 03:27:43,585
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1894
03:27:43,609 --> 03:27:45,153
Share it?

1895
03:27:46,988 --> 03:27:49,407
No. No.

1896
03:27:50,908 --> 03:27:52,243
Dead plant and all that.

1897
03:27:52,660 --> 03:27:54,829
Don't think he'd understand.

1898
03:27:56,080 --> 03:27:58,291
Could be a distant relative.

1899
03:27:59,083 --> 03:28:01,586
I get it.

1900
03:28:01,753 --> 03:28:04,589
Don't be hasty.

1901
03:28:05,673 --> 03:28:07,425
Exactly.

1902
03:28:08,509 --> 03:28:10,762
Bar-hrum.

1903
03:28:36,412 --> 03:28:37,705
This is the old sewer.

1904
03:28:37,872 --> 03:28:41,000
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1905
03:28:41,167 --> 03:28:42,919
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1906
03:28:43,961 --> 03:28:46,464
Captain Faramir...

1907
03:28:47,090 --> 03:28:48,925
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1908
03:28:51,427 --> 03:28:52,720
The very highest.

1909
03:28:53,221 --> 03:28:55,848
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1910
03:28:56,015 --> 03:28:58,976
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1911
03:29:00,144 --> 03:29:02,146
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1912
03:29:02,730 --> 03:29:04,315
Gollum says there's a path...

1913
03:29:04,482 --> 03:29:08,403
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1914
03:29:08,861 --> 03:29:10,613
Cirith Ungol?

1915
03:29:14,158 --> 03:29:16,702
- Is that its name?
- No.

1916
03:29:16,869 --> 03:29:18,538
No!

1917
03:29:19,372 --> 03:29:22,375
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1918
03:29:22,750 --> 03:29:26,295
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1919
03:29:27,171 --> 03:29:29,715
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1920
03:29:30,049 --> 03:29:36,347
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1921
03:29:37,849 --> 03:29:39,642
I must.

1922
03:29:43,187 --> 03:29:46,774
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1923
03:29:46,941 --> 03:29:48,985
Thank you.

1924
03:30:00,788 --> 03:30:04,917
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1925
03:30:17,388 --> 03:30:18,931
Come on, keep up.

1926
03:30:22,393 --> 03:30:25,188
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1927
03:30:25,813 --> 03:30:27,648
You know that, don't you?

1928
03:30:28,441 --> 03:30:30,026
He was trying to save you, see?

1929
03:30:30,526 --> 03:30:32,069
Save me?

1930
03:30:32,403 --> 03:30:34,572
So there's no hard feelings.

1931
03:30:34,739 --> 03:30:39,869
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1932
03:30:40,036 --> 03:30:42,663
Gollum, Gollum.

1933
03:30:43,706 --> 03:30:45,458
Nice master.

1934
03:30:46,542 --> 03:30:49,378
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1935
03:30:49,545 --> 03:30:51,839
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1936
03:30:57,345 --> 03:31:02,558
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1937
03:31:09,690 --> 03:31:12,693
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1938
03:31:13,361 --> 03:31:16,906
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1939
03:31:22,036 --> 03:31:25,456
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1940
03:31:26,457 --> 03:31:29,669
<i>...somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

1941
03:31:32,964 --> 03:31:36,384
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1942
03:31:36,551 --> 03:31:37,927
What?

1943
03:31:38,094 --> 03:31:42,056
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1944
03:31:42,223 --> 03:31:45,476
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1945
03:31:45,643 --> 03:31:48,604
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1946
03:31:48,771 --> 03:31:50,439
"Yes, my boy.

1947
03:31:50,606 --> 03:31:54,402
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1948
03:31:54,569 --> 03:31:57,113
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1949
03:31:57,280 --> 03:31:59,156
"Samwise the Brave."

1950
03:31:59,323 --> 03:32:02,076
I want to hear more about Sam.

1951
03:32:06,372 --> 03:32:09,375
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1952
03:32:10,710 --> 03:32:14,755
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1953
03:32:15,840 --> 03:32:17,216
So was I.

1954
03:32:26,100 --> 03:32:28,811
"Samwise the Brave."

1955
03:32:33,065 --> 03:32:34,400
Sméagol?

1956
03:32:34,567 --> 03:32:37,486
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1957
03:32:37,653 --> 03:32:39,572
Master.

1958
03:32:39,739 --> 03:32:42,700
Master looks after us.

1959
03:32:43,492 --> 03:32:46,287
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1960
03:32:46,454 --> 03:32:48,914
Master broke his promise.

1961
03:32:49,081 --> 03:32:51,250
Don't ask Sméagol.

1962
03:32:51,417 --> 03:32:54,629
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1963
03:32:54,795 --> 03:32:57,632
Master betrayed us.

1964
03:32:57,798 --> 03:33:00,885
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1965
03:33:01,052 --> 03:33:04,972
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1966
03:33:05,139 --> 03:33:07,892
Kill him! Kill him!

1967
03:33:08,059 --> 03:33:09,560
Kill them both!

1968
03:33:09,727 --> 03:33:13,356
And then we take the precious...

1969
03:33:13,522 --> 03:33:17,068
...and we be the master!

1970
03:33:17,735 --> 03:33:20,404
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1971
03:33:20,571 --> 03:33:23,240
Eyes always watching.

1972
03:33:23,407 --> 03:33:26,952
Then we stabs them out.

1973
03:33:27,119 --> 03:33:31,624
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1974
03:33:31,791 --> 03:33:35,252
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1975
03:33:35,419 --> 03:33:38,130
Kill them both.

1976
03:33:38,297 --> 03:33:40,800
Yes. No! No!

1977
03:33:40,966 --> 03:33:44,679
It's too risky.
It's too risky.

1978
03:33:45,388 --> 03:33:47,973
Where is he?
Where has he gone?

1979
03:33:48,140 --> 03:33:50,768
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

1980
03:33:50,935 --> 03:33:56,315
We could let her do it.

1981
03:33:57,274 --> 03:34:01,445
Yes. She could do it.

1982
03:34:01,612 --> 03:34:06,158
Yes, precious, she could.

1983
03:34:06,325 --> 03:34:12,373
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1984
03:34:13,290 --> 03:34:15,042
Once they're dead.

1985
03:34:15,209 --> 03:34:17,211
Shh.

1986
03:34:20,548 --> 03:34:24,260
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.

1987
03:34:24,427 --> 03:34:26,470
Sméagol will show you the way.

1988
03:34:26,637 --> 03:34:28,889
Follow me.
