Shrek?
But do you know, what I
like about you, Shrek?
You've got that kind of:
"I don't care what nobody
thinks of me" thing. I like that, I respect that,
Shrek. You're all right.
Uh, look at that.
Who would wanna
live in a place
like that? That would
be my home. Oh, it is
lovely. Just beautiful l.
You know you're quite a
decorator. It's amazing what you did
with such a modest budget. I
like that boulder. That is a
nice boulder. I guess,
you don't entertain much, do you?
I like my privacy.

- Yes, I know the muffin-man.
Who lives on Proully lane?
Well, she's married to the muffin-man.
- The muffin-man.

A..., felonious.
You were saying.

```The provided text is a poorly formatted string with individual characters separated by spaces. For the purpose of linguistic analysis, I will first reconstruct the text into a readable format:

"I mean, after all, you did rescue me. Thanks. Well, eat up. Weâ€™ve got a big day ahead of us. Shrek. - What? It's a complaint. Better out than in I always say. But that's no way to behave in front of a princess. Thanks. - Sheâ€™s as nasty as you are. You know. Youâ€™re not exactly what Iâ€™ve expecte[d. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. Princess. What are you doing? MÃ´ n she[ry, for I am your saviour. And I am rescuin[g you from this green...beast. Hey.
