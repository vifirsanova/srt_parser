Ã¯  1  i the world is changed   i 
 i i feel it in the water   i 
 i i feel it in the earth   i 
 i i smell it in the air   i 
 i much that once was     i 
 i    is lost   i 
 i for none now live who remember it   i 
 i it began with the forging of the great rings   i 
 i three were given to the elves   i 
 i immortal  wisest and fairest of all beings   i 
 i seven to the dwarf lords   i 
 i great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls   i 
 i and nine     i 
 i    nine rings were gifted to the race of men     i 
 i    who  above all else  desire power   i 
 i for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race   i 
 i but they were all of them deceived   i 
 i for another ring was made   i 
 i in the land of mordor  in the fires of mount doom     i 
 i    the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring     i 
 i    to control all others   i 
 i and into this ring he poured his cruelty  his malice     i 
 i    and his will to dominate all life   i 
 i one ring to rule them all   i 
 i one by one     i 
 i    the free lands of middle earth fell to the power of the ring   i 
 i but there were some who resisted   i 
 i a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor   i 
 i and on the slopes of mount doom  they fought for the freedom of middle earth   i 
 i victory was near   i 
 i but the power of the ring     i 
 i    could not be undone   i 
 i it was in this moment     i 
 i    when all hope had faded     i 
 i    that isildur  son of the king  took up his father's sword   i 
 i sauron  the enemy of the free peoples of middle earth  was defeated   i 
 i the ring passed to isildur     i 
 i    who had this one chance to destroy evil forever   i 
 i but the hearts of men     i 
 i    are easily corrupted   i 
 i and the ring of power has a will of its own   i 
 i it betrayed isildur     i 
 i    to his death   i 
 i and some things that should not have been forgotten     i 
 i    were lost   i 
 i history became legend     i 
 i    legend became myth   i 
 i and for two and a half thousand years     i 
 i    the ring passed out of all knowledge   i 
 i until  when chance came     i 
 i    it ensnared a new bearer   i 
my precious 
 i the ring came to the creature gollum     i 
 i    who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains   i 
 i and there it consumed him   i 
it came to me 
my own  my love  my own 
my precious 
 i the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life   i 
 i for 500 years it poisoned his mind   i 
 i and in the gloom of gollum's cave  it waited   i 
 i darkness crept back into the forests of the world   i 
 i rumor grew of a shadow in the east     i 
 i    whispers of a nameless fear   i 
 i and the ring of power perceived     i 
 i    its time had now come   i 
 i it abandoned gollum   i 
 i but something happened then the ring did not intend   i 
 i it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable   i 
what's this 
 i a hobbit   i 
 i bilbo baggins of the shire   i 
a ring 
lost 
my precious is lost 
 i for the time will soon come     i 
 i    when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all   i 
the 22nd day of september   
   in the year 1400   
   by shire reckoning 
bag end  bagshot row  hobbiton  westfarthing   
   the shire   
   middle earth 
the third age of this world 
 i there and back again   i 
 i a hobbit's tale   i 
by bilbo baggins 
now   
   where to begin 
ah  yes   
 concerning   
   hobbits  
 i hobbits have been living and farming in the four farthings of the shire     i 
 i    for many hundreds of years     i 
 i    quite content to ignore and be ignored     i 
 i    by the world of the big folk   i 
 i middle earth being  after all  full of strange creatures beyond count     i 
 i    hobbits must seem of little importance     i 
 i    being neither renowned as great warriors     i 
 i    nor counted among the very wise   i 
frodo  someone at the door 
 i in fact  it has been remarked by some     i 
 i    that hobbits' only real passion is for food   i 
 i a rather unfair observation     i 
 i    as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales     i 
 i    and the smoking of pipe weed   i 
 i but where our hearts truly lie     i 
 i    is in peace and quiet     i 
 i    and good  tilled earth   i 
 i for all hobbits share a love of things that grow   i 
 i and  yes  no doubt to others  our ways seem quaint   i 
 i but today of all days  it is brought home to me   i 
 i it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life   i 
frodo  the door 
sticklebacks  where is that boy 
frodo 
 i down from the door where it began  i 
 i and i must follow if i can  i 
 i the road goes ever on and on  i 
 i down from the door where it began  i 
 i now far ahead the road has gone  i 
 i   and i must follow if i can  i    you're late 
a wizard is never late  frodo baggins 
nor is he early  he arrives precisely when he means to 
it's wonderful to see you  gandalf 
you didn't think i'd miss your uncle bilbo's birthday 
how is the old rascal 
i hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence 
you know bilbo  he's got the whole place in an uproar 
well  that should please him 
half the shire's been invited 
and the rest of them are turning up anyway 
 i and so life in the shire goes on     i 
 i    very much as it has this past age     i 
 i    full of its own comings and goings  with change coming slowly   i 
 i if it comes at all   i 
 i for things are made to endure in the shire     i 
 i    passing from one generation to the next   i 
 i there's always been a baggins living here under the hill     i 
 i    in bag end   i 
and there always will be 
to tell you the truth  bilbo's been a bit odd lately 
i mean  more than usual 
he's taken to locking himself in his study 
 i he spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks i'm not looking   i 
where's it gone 
he's up to something 
  all right  then  keep your secrets    what 
but i know you have something to do with it 
good gracious me 
before you came along  we bagginses were very well thought of 
indeed 
never had any adventures or did anything unexpected 
if you're referring to the incident with the dragon  i was barely involved 
all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door 
whatever you did  you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace 
oh  really 
gandalf  gandalf 
fireworks  gandalf 
  gandalf    fireworks  gandalf 
gandalf 
  i'm glad you're back    so am i  dear boy 
so am i 
whoa  whoa 
no  thank you 
we don't want any more visitors  well wishers or distant relations 
and what about very old friends 
gandalf 
  bilbo baggins    my dear gandalf 
good to see you  111 years old  who would believe it 
you haven't aged a day 
come on  come in 
welcome  welcome 
oh  here we are 
tea  or maybe something a little stronger 
i've got a few bottles of the old winyard left  1296 
very good year  almost as old as i am 
it was laid down by my father  what say we open one  eh 
just tea  thank you 
oh 
i was expecting you sometime last week 
not that it matters  you come and go as you please  always have and always will 
you caught me a bit unprepared  we've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle   
there's some cheese here  no  that won't do 
we've got raspberry jam  an apple tart   
but not much for afters  oh  no  we're all right 
i've just found some sponge cake 
i could make you some eggs if you'd  
  just tea  thank you    oh  right 
  you don't mind if i eat  do you    no  not at all 
bilbo  bilbo baggins 
i'm not at home 
it's the sackville bagginses 
  i know you're in there    they're after the house 
they've never forgiven me for living this long 
i've got to get away from these confounded relatives  hanging on the bell all day   
   never giving me a moment's peace 
i want to see mountains again  mountains  gandalf 
and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book  oh  tea 
  so you mean to go through with your plan    yes  yes  it's all in hand 
all the arrangements are made 
oh  thank you 
frodo suspects something 
of course he does  he's a baggins   
   not some blockheaded bracegirdle from hardbottle 
you will tell him  won't you 
  yes  yes    he's very fond of you 
i know 
he'd probably come with me if i asked him 
i think in his heart  frodo's still in love with the shire 
the woods  the fields 
little rivers 
i am old  gandalf 
i know i don't look it  but i'm beginning to feel it in my heart 
i feel thin 
sort of stretched   
   like butter scraped over too much bread 
i need a holiday  a very long holiday 
and i don't expect i shall return 
in fact  i mean not to 
old toby  the finest weed in the southfarthing 
ah 
gandalf  my old friend   
   this will be a night to remember 
hello  hello 
fatty bolger  lovely to see you  welcome  welcome 
go on  sam  ask rosie for a dance 
  i think i'll just have another ale    oh  no  you don't 
go on 
so there i was   
   at the mercy of three monstrous trolls 
and they were all arguing amongst themselves   
   about how they were going to cook us 
whether it be turned on a spit  or to sit on us one by one  squash us into jelly 
they spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors   
   that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees   
   and turned them all to stone 
quickly 
whoa 
up they go 
no  the big one 
mrs  bracegirdle  how nice to see you  welcome  welcome 
are all these children yours 
good gracious  you have been productive 
bilbo 
sackville bagginses 
quickly  hide 
thank you  my boy 
you're a good lad  frodo 
i'm very selfish  you know 
yes  i am  very selfish 
i don't know why i took you in after your mother and father died   
   but it wasn't out of charity 
i think it was because   
   of all my numerous relations   
   you were the one baggins that showed real spirit 
bilbo  have you been at the gaffer's home brew 
no 
well  yes  but that's not the point 
the point is  frodo   
   you'll be all right 
  done    you're supposed to stick it in the ground 
  it is in the ground    outside 
this was your idea 
bilbo 
bilbo  watch out for the dragon 
nonsense  there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years 
  that was good    let's get another one 
meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took 
i might've known 
speech  bilbo 
speech 
speech 
my dear bagginses and boffins   
   tooks and brandybucks   
   grubbs  chubbs   
   hornblowers   
   bolgers   
   bracegirdles   
     and proudfoots    proudfeet 
today is my 111th birthday 
happy birthday 
but alas  eleventy one years is far too short a time to live among   
   such excellent and admirable hobbits 
i don't know half of you half as well as i should like   
   and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve 
i  uh  
i have things to do 
i've put this off far too long 
i regret to announce this is the end 
i'm going now 
i bid you all a very fond farewell 
goodbye 
i suppose you think that was terribly clever 
come on  gandalf  did you see their faces 
there are many magic rings in this world  and none of them should be used lightly 
it was just a bit of fun 
oh  you're probably right  as usual 
  you will keep an eye on frodo  won't you    two eyes 
as often as i can spare them 
  i'm leaving everything to him    what about this ring of yours 
  is that staying too    yes  yes 
it's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece 
no  wait  it's   
   here in my pocket 
isn't that    isn't that odd  now 
yet  after all  why not 
  why shouldn't i keep it    i think you should leave the ring behind 
is that so hard 
well  no 
and yes 
now it comes to it  i don't feel like parting with it 
it's mine  i found it  it came to me 
  there's no need to get angry    well  if i'm angry  it's your fault 
it's mine 
my own 
  my precious    precious 
it's been called that before  but not by you 
what business is it of yours what i do with my own things 
i think you've had that ring quite long enough 
  you want it for yourself    bilbo baggins 
do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks 
i am not trying to rob you 
i'm trying to help you 
all your long years  we've been friends 
trust me as you once did 
let it go 
you're right  gandalf 
the ring must go to frodo 
it's late  the road is long 
yes  it is time 
  bilbo    hm 
the ring is still in your pocket 
ah  yes 
i've thought up an ending for my book 
 and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days  
and i'm sure you will  my dear friend 
goodbye  gandalf 
goodbye  dear bilbo 
 i the road goes ever on and on  i 
until our next meeting 
 i it's mine  my own   i 
 i my precious   i 
riddles in the dark 
bilbo 
bilbo 
my precious 
precious 
he's gone  hasn't he 
he talked for so long about leaving   
   i didn't think he'd really do it 
gandalf 
bilbo's ring 
he's gone to stay with the elves 
he's left you bag end 
along with all his possessions 
the ring is yours now 
  put it somewhere out of sight    where are you going 
  there are some things that i must see to    what things 
  questions  questions that need answering    you've only just arrived 
i don't understand 
neither do i 
keep it secret 
keep it safe 
 i shire   i 
 i baggins   i 
 i  the year 3434 of the second age   i 
 i here follows the account of isildur  high king of gondor     i 
 i    and the finding of the ring of power    i 
 i  it has come to me   i 
 i the one ring  it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom   i 
 i all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate     i 
 i    for i will risk no hurt to the ring   i 
 i it is precious to me     i 
 i    though i buy it with great pain   i 
 i the markings upon the band begin to fade   i 
 i the writing  which at first was as clear as red flame  has all but disappeared   i 
 i a secret now that only fire can tell    i 
shire 
baggins 
there's no bagginses around here  they're all up in hobbiton 
that way 
 i to heal my heart and drown my woe  i 
 i rain may fall and wind may blow  i 
 i but there still be  i 
 i many miles to go  i 
 i sweet is the sound of the pouring rain  i 
 i and the stream that falls from hill to plain  i 
 i better than rain or rippling brook  i 
 i is a mug of beer inside this took  i 
there's been some strange folk crossing the shire 
dwarves and others of a less than savory nature 
war is brewing 
the mountains are fair teeming with goblins 
far off tales and children's stories  that's all that is 
you're beginning to sound like that old bilbo baggins  cracked  he was 
young mr  frodo here  he's cracking 
and proud of it 
  cheers  gaffer    cheers 
it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders 
keep your nose out of trouble  and no trouble'll come to you 
  good night  lads    good night 
good night  sweet maiden of the golden ale 
mind who you're sweet talking 
don't worry  sam  rosie knows an idiot when she sees one 
does she 
  good night  sam    good night  mr  frodo 
is it secret  is it safe 
ah 
what are you doing 
hold out your hand  frodo 
it's quite cool 
what can you see 
can you see anything 
nothing 
there's nothing 
wait 
there are markings 
it's some form of elvish  i can't read it 
there are few who can 
the language is that of mordor  which i will not utter here 
mordor 
in the common tongue  it says 
 one ring to rule them all   
   one ring to find them   
   one ring to bring them all   
   and in the darkness bind them  
this is the one ring   
   forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom 
taken by isildur from the hand of sauron himself 
bilbo found it 
  in gollum's cave    yes 
for 60 years  the ring lay quiet in bilbo's keeping   
   prolonging his life  delaying old age 
but no longer  frodo  evil is stirring in mordor 
the ring has awoken 
it's heard its master's call 
but he was destroyed  sauron was destroyed 
no  frodo 
the spirit of sauron endured 
his life force is bound to the ring  and the ring survived 
sauron has returned 
his orcs have multiplied 
his fortress at barad dÃ£ r is rebuilt in the land of mordor 
sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness 
he is seeking it 
seeking it  all his thought is bent on it 
for the ring yearns above all else   
   to return to the hand of its master 
they are one   
   the ring and the dark lord 
frodo   
   he must never find it 
all right 
we put it away  we keep it hidden  we never speak of it again 
no one knows it's here  do they 
do they  gandalf 
there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring 
i looked everywhere for the creature gollum 
but the enemy found him first 
 i i don't know how long they tortured him   i 
 i but amidst the endless screams and inane babble  they discerned two words   i 
shire 
baggins 
shire 
baggins  but that would lead them here 
who goes there 
take it  gandalf 
  take it    no  frodo 
  you must take it    you cannot offer me this ring 
  i'm giving it to you    don't tempt me  frodo 
i dare not take it 
not even to keep it safe 
understand  frodo   
   i would use this ring from a desire to do good 
but through me  it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine 
  but it cannot stay in the shire    no 
no  it can't 
what must i do 
  you must leave  and leave quickly    where  where do i go 
get out of the shire  make for the village of bree 
bree 
  what about you    i'll be waiting for you   
   at the inn of the prancing pony 
  and the ring will be safe there    i don't know  frodo 
i don't have any answers 
i must see the head of my order  he is both wise and powerful  trust me  frodo 
he'll know what to do 
you'll have to leave the name of baggins behind you 
that name is not safe outside the shire 
travel only by day  and stay off the road 
i can cut across country easily enough 
my dear frodo 
hobbits really are amazing creatures 
you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month 
and yet  after a hundred years   
   they can still surprise you 
get down 
confound it all  samwise gamgee  have you been eavesdropping 
i haven't been dropping no eaves  honest  i was cutting the grass under the window 
a little late for trimming the verge  don't you think 
  i heard raised voices    what did you hear  speak 
nothing important 
that is  i heard a good deal about a ring  a dark lord and the end of the world but  
please  mr  gandalf  sir  don't hurt me  don't turn me into anything unnatural 
no 
perhaps not 
i've thought of a better use for you 
come along  samwise  keep up 
be careful  both of you 
the enemy has many spies in his service 
birds  beasts 
is it safe 
never put it on   
   for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power 
always remember  frodo   
   the ring is trying to get back to its master 
it wants to be found 
this is it 
this is what 
if i take one more step   
   it'll be the farthest away from home i've ever been 
come on  sam 
remember what bilbo used to say 
   it's a dangerous business  frodo    i    going out your door   i 
 i you step onto the road  and if you don't keep your feet     i 
 i    there's no knowing where you might be swept off to    i 
sam 
wood elves 
they're going to the harbor beyond the white towers 
to the grey havens 
they're leaving middle earth 
never to return 
i don't know why   
   it makes me sad 
everywhere i lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back 
just shut your eyes   
   and imagine you're back in your own bed   
   with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow 
it's not working  mr  frodo 
i'm never going to be able to sleep out here 
me neither  sam 
 i smoke rises from the mountain of doom   i 
 i the hour grows late   i 
 i and gandalf the grey rides to isengard     i 
 i    seeking my counsel   i 
for that is why you have come  is it not 
my old friend 
saruman 
  you are sure of this    beyond any doubt 
so the ring of power has been found 
all these long years  it was in the shire 
  under my very nose    yet you did not have the wit to see it 
your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind 
but we still have time  time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly 
time 
what time do you think we have 
sauron has regained much of his former strength 
he cannot yet take physical form   
   but his spirit has lost none of its potency 
concealed within his fortress  the lord of mordor sees all 
his gaze pierces cloud  shadow  earth and flesh 
you know of what i speak  gandalf 
a great eye  lidless  wreathed in flame 
the eye of sauron 
he is gathering all evil to him 
very soon  he'll have summoned an army great enough   
   for an assault upon middle earth 
you know this 
how 
i have seen it 
a palantÃ£ r is a dangerous tool  saruman 
why 
why should we fear to use it 
they are not all accounted for  the lost seeing stones 
we do not know who else may be watching 
the hour is later than you think 
sauron's forces are already moving 
the nine have left minas morgul 
the nine 
they crossed the river isen on midsummer's eve   
   disguised as riders in black 
  they've reached the shire    they will find the ring 
and kill the one who carries it 
frodo 
you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron 
there are none who can 
against the power of mordor   
   there can be no victory 
we must join with him  gandalf 
we must join with sauron 
it would be wise  my friend 
tell me   
   friend   
   when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness 
i gave you the chance   
   of aiding me willingly   
   but you have elected the way of pain 
mr  frodo 
frodo  frodo 
  i thought i'd lost you    what are you talking about 
  it's just something gandalf said    what did he say 
 don't you lose him  samwise gamgee   and i don't mean to 
sam  we're still in the shire  what could possibly happen 
frodo 
  merry  it's frodo baggins    hello  frodo 
get off him 
come on  frodo 
what's the meaning of this 
you've been into farmer maggot's crop 
you get back here 
get out of my field 
you'll know the devil if i catch up with you 
i don't know why he's so upset  it's only a couple of carrots 
and some cabbages 
and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week 
  and then the mushrooms the week before    yes  pippin  my point is   
   he's clearly overreacting 
run 
oh  that was close 
i think i've broken something 
trust a brandybuck and a took 
what  that was just a detour  a short cut 
  short cut to what    mushrooms 
that's mine 
that's nice  merry 
here's a nice one  sam 
i think we should get off the road 
get off the road 
quick 
be quiet 
what was that 
anything 
nothing 
what is going on 
that black rider was looking for something  or someone 
frodo 
get down 
i have to leave the shire 
sam and i must get to bree 
right 
bucklebury ferry  follow me 
run 
this way  follow me 
run 
get the rope  sam 
frodo 
run  frodo 
  go    hurry 
frodo  come on 
  come on  faster    jump 
  how far to the nearest crossing    the brandywine bridge  20 miles 
come on 
  what do you want    we're heading for the prancing pony 
hobbits  four hobbits 
what's more  out of the shire by your talk  what business brings you to bree 
we wish to stay at the inn  our business is our own 
all right  young sir  i meant no offense 
it's my job to ask questions after nightfall 
there's talk of strange folk abroad 
can't be too careful 
out of the way  watch where you're walking 
excuse me 
good evening  little masters  what can i do for you 
if you're seeking accommodation  we got some cozy hobbit sized rooms available 
always proud to cater to the little folk  mister    
underhill  my name's underhill 
  underhill  yes    we're friends of gandalf the grey 
  can you tell him we've arrived    gandalf 
gandalf 
oh  yes   
   i remember  elderly chap 
big grey beard  pointy hat 
not seen him for six months 
what do we do now 
sam   
   he'll be here  he'll come 
get out of my way 
what's that 
this  my friend  is a pint 
it comes in pints 
  i'm getting one    you got a whole half already 
that fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived 
excuse me 
that man in the corner  who is he 
he's one of them rangers  they're dangerous folk  wandering the wilds 
what his right name is  i've never heard  but around here he's known as strider 
strider 
 i baggins   i 
 i baggins   i 
 i baggins  baggins   i 
baggins  sure  i know a baggins 
he's over there  frodo baggins 
he's my second cousin  once removed on his mother's side   
   and my third cousin  twice removed   
  pippin    steady on  frodo 
you cannot hide 
i see you 
there is no life   
   in the void 
only   
   death 
you draw far too much attention to yourself   mr  underhill  
what do you want 
a little more caution from you  that is no trinket you carry 
  i carry nothing    indeed 
i can avoid being seen if i wish   
   but to disappear entirely  that is a rare gift 
  who are you    are you frightened 
yes 
not nearly frightened enough  i know what hunts you 
let him go  or i'll have you  longshanks 
you have a stout heart  little hobbit  but that will not save you 
you can no longer wait for the wizard  frodo 
they're coming 
what are they 
they were once men 
great kings of men 
then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power 
blinded by their greed  they took them without question 
one by one  falling into darkness 
now they are slaves to his will 
they are the nazgÃ£ l 
ringwraiths  neither living nor dead 
at all times they feel   
 i    the presence of the ring     i 
 i    drawn to the power of the one  they will never stop hunting you   i 
  where are you taking us    into the wild 
how do we know this strider is a friend of gandalf 
i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer   
     and feel fouler    he's foul enough 
we have no choice but to trust him 
  but where is he leading us    to rivendell  master gamgee 
  to the house of elrond    did you hear that  rivendell 
we're going to see the elves 
  gentlemen  we do not stop till nightfall    what about breakfast 
  you've already had it    we've had one  yes 
what about second breakfast 
don't think he knows about second breakfast  pip 
what about elevenses  luncheon  afternoon tea  dinner  supper 
  he knows about them  doesn't he    i wouldn't count on it 
pippin 
what do they eat when they can't get hobbit 
who is she 
this woman you sing of 
'tis the lady of lÃ£Âºthien 
the elf maiden who gave her love to beren  a mortal 
what happened to her 
she died 
get some sleep  frodo 
 i the power of isengard is at your command     i 
 i    sauron  lord of the earth   i 
 i build me an army worthy of mordor   i 
what orders from mordor  my lord  what does the eye command 
we have work to do 
the trees are strong  my lord  their roots go deep 
rip them all down 
this was the great watchtower of amon sÃ£ l 
we shall rest here tonight 
these are for you  keep them close 
i'm going to have a look around 
stay here 
my tomato's burst 
could i have some bacon 
want a tomato  sam 
  what are you doing     tomatoes  sausages  nice crispy bacon 
  we saved some for you  mr  frodo    put it out  you fools 
  put it out    that's nice  ash on my tomatoes 
go 
back  you devils 
frodo 
  frodo    oh  sam 
strider 
  help him  strider    he's been stabbed by a morgul blade 
this is beyond my skill to heal  he needs elvish medicine 
hurry 
we're six days from rivendell  he'll never make it 
hold on  frodo 
gandalf 
look  frodo  it's mr  bilbo's trolls 
mr  frodo  he's going cold 
is he going to die 
he's passing into the shadow world  he'll soon become a wraith like them 
  they're close    sam  do you know the athelas plant 
  athelas    kingsfoil 
kingsfoil  aye  it's a weed 
it may help to slow the poisoning  hurry 
what's this  a ranger caught off his guard 
frodo 
who is she 
frodo 
  she's an elf    he's fading 
he's not going to last 
we must get him to my father 
  i've been looking for you for two days    where are you taking him 
there are five wraiths behind you  where the other four are  i do not know 
what are they saying 
i do not fear them 
arwen   
   ride hard  don't look back 
what are you doing   those wraiths are still out there 
give up the halfling  she elf 
if you want him  come and claim him 
no  no 
frodo  no 
frodo  don't give in 
not now 
 i what grace is given me     i 
 i    let it pass to him   i 
 i let him be spared   i 
 i save him   i 
  where am i    you are in the house of elrond 
and it is 10 00 in the morning on october 24th  if you want to know 
  gandalf    yes  i'm here 
and you're lucky to be here too 
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid 
but you have some strength in you  my dear hobbit 
what happened  gandalf 
  why didn't you meet us    i am sorry  frodo 
i was delayed 
a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside 
one ill turn deserves another  it is over 
embrace the power of the ring   
   or embrace your own destruction 
there is only one lord of the ring 
only one who can bend it to his will 
and he does not share power 
so you have chosen death 
gandalf  what is it 
nothing  frodo 
frodo 
frodo 
  sam    bless you  you're awake 
sam has hardly left your side 
we were that worried about you  weren't we  mr  gandalf 
by the skills of lord elrond  you're beginning to mend 
welcome to rivendell  frodo baggins 
  bilbo    hello  frodo  my lad 
bilbo 
 i  there and back again   i 
 i a hobbit's tale   i  by bilbo baggins  
  this is wonderful    i meant to go back   
   wonder at the powers of mirkwood   
   visit lake town   
   see the lonely mountain again 
but age  it seems  has finally caught up with me 
i miss the shire 
i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else 
off with you  on one of your adventures 
but my own adventure turned out to be quite different 
i'm not like you  bilbo 
my dear boy 
  now  what have i forgotten    packed already 
no harm in being prepared 
  i thought you wanted to see the elves    i do 
  more than anything    i did 
it's just   
we did what gandalf wanted  didn't we 
we got the ring this far  to rivendell  and i thought   
   seeing as how you're on the mend  we'd be off soon 
off home 
you are right  sam 
we did what we set out to do 
the ring will be safe in rivendell 
i am ready to go home 
his strength returns 
that wound will never fully heal  he will carry it the rest of his life 
and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring   
   the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil 
it is a burden he should never have had to bear 
  we can ask no more of frodo    gandalf  the enemy is moving 
sauron's forces are massing in the east  his eye is fixed on rivendell 
and saruman  you tell me  has betrayed us 
our list of allies grows thin 
his treachery runs deeper than you know 
by foul craft  saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men 
he's breeding an army in the caverns of isengard 
an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed 
saruman is coming for the ring 
this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves 
we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard 
gandalf   
   the ring cannot stay here 
 i this peril belongs to all middle earth   i 
 i they must decide now how to end it   i 
the time of the elves is over  my people are leaving these shores 
who will you look to when we've gone  the dwarves 
they hide in mountains seeking riches  they care not for the troubles of others 
it is in men that we must place our hope 
men 
men are weak  the race of men is failing 
the blood of nÃ£Âºmenor is all but spent  its pride and dignity forgotten 
it is because of men the ring survives 
i was there  gandalf 
 i i was there 3000 years ago     i 
 i    when isildur took the ring   i 
i was there the day the strength of men failed 
isildur  hurry  follow me 
 i i led isildur into the heart of mount doom     i 
 i    where the ring was forged  the one place it could be destroyed   i 
cast it into the fire 
  destroy it    no 
isildur 
 i it should have ended that day  but evil was allowed to endure   i 
isildur kept the ring  the line of kings is broken 
there's no strength left in the world of men 
  they're scattered  divided  leaderless    there is one who could unite them 
one who could reclaim the throne of gondor 
he turned from that path a long time ago 
he has chosen exile 
you are no elf 
men of the south are welcome here 
  who are you    i am a friend to gandalf the grey 
then we are here on common purpose   
   friend 
the shards of narsil 
the blade that cut the ring from sauron's hand 
it's still sharp 
but no more than a broken heirloom 
why do you fear the past 
you are isildur's heir  not isildur himself 
you are not bound to his fate 
the same blood flows in my veins 
the same weakness 
your time will come 
you will face the same evil  and you will defeat it 
you said you'd bind yourself to me   
   forsaking the immortal life of your people 
and to that i hold 
i would rather share one lifetime with you   
   than face all the ages of this world alone 
i choose a mortal life 
  you cannot give me this    it is mine to give to whom i will   
   like my heart 
strangers from distant lands  friends of old   
   you've been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor 
middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction  none can escape it 
you will unite  or you will fall 
each race is bound to this fate  this one doom 
bring forth the ring  frodo 
so it is true 
in a dream   
   i saw the eastern sky grow dark   
   but in the west a pale light lingered 
a voice was crying 
 your doom is near at hand 
isildur's bane is found  
isildur's bane 
boromir 
never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in imladris 
i do not ask your pardon  master elrond   
   for the black speech of mordor   
   may yet be heard   
   in every corner of the west 
the ring is altogether evil 
it is a gift 
a gift to the foes of mordor 
why not use this ring 
long has my father  the steward of gondor   
   kept the forces of mordor at bay  by the blood of our people   
   are your lands kept safe 
give gondor the weapon of the enemy  let us use it against him 
you cannot wield it  none of us can 
the one ring answers to sauron alone  it has no other master 
and what would a ranger know of this matter 
this is no mere ranger 
he is aragorn  son of arathorn 
you owe him your allegiance 
aragorn 
this is isildur's heir 
and heir to the throne of gondor 
gondor has no king 
gondor needs no king 
aragorn is right  we cannot use it 
you have only one choice 
the ring must be destroyed 
what are we waiting for 
the ring cannot be destroyed  gimli  son of glÃ£Â³in   
   by any craft that we here possess 
the ring was made in the fires of mount doom 
only there can it be unmade 
it must be taken deep into mordor   
   and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came 
one of you   
   must do this 
one does not simply walk into mordor 
its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs 
there is evil there that does not sleep 
the great eye is ever watchful 
it is a barren wasteland   
   riddled with fire  and ash and dust 
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume 
not with 10 000 men could you do this  it is folly 
have you heard nothing lord elrond has said  the ring must be destroyed 
and i suppose you think you are the one to do it 
and if we fail  what then  what happens when sauron takes back what is his 
i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf 
never trust an elf 
do you not understand  while you bicker  sauron's power grows 
none can escape it  you'll all be destroyed 
i will take it 
i will take it 
i will take the ring to mordor 
though   
   i do not know the way 
i will help you bear this burden  frodo baggins   
   as long as it is yours to bear 
if by my life or death i can protect you   
   i will 
you have my sword 
and you have my bow 
and my ax 
you carry the fates of us all  little one 
if this is indeed the will of the council   
     then gondor will see it done    hey 
  frodo's not going anywhere without me    it is hardly possible to separate you   
   even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not 
we're coming too 
you'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us 
anyway  you need people of intelligence on this sort of   
   mission 
quest 
thing 
well  that rules you out  pip 
nine companions 
so be it 
you shall be the fellowship of the ring 
great 
where are we going 
in her heart  your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life 
that you'd never escape your fate 
the skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings   
   but only you have the power to wield it 
i do not want that power 
i have never wanted it 
you are the last of that bloodline  there is no other 
my old sword  sting 
here  take it  take it 
  it's so light    yes  made by the elves  you know 
the blade glows blue when orcs are close 
and it's times like that  my lad  when you have to be extra careful 
here's a pretty thing 
mithril 
as light as a feather  and as hard as dragon scales 
let me see you put it on  come on 
oh 
my old ring 
i should very much like   
   to hold it again  one last time 
i'm sorry i brought this upon you  my boy 
i'm sorry that you must carry this burden 
i'm sorry for everything 
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom 
on you who travel with him  no oath   
   nor bond is laid to go further than you will 
farewell  hold to your purpose 
may the blessings of elves and men   
   and all free folk go with you 
the fellowship awaits the ring bearer 
mordor  gandalf  is it left or right 
left 
 i we must hold to this course  west of the misty mountains  for 40 days   i 
 i if our luck holds  the gap of rohan will still be open to us   i 
 i from there  our road turns east to mordor   i 
two  one  five  good  very good 
move your feet 
  you look good  pippin    thanks 
faster 
if anyone was to ask for my opinion  which i note they're not   
   i'd say we were taking the long way 'round 
gandalf  we could pass through the mines of moria 
my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome 
no  i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice 
sorry 
get him 
  for the shire    hold him  hold him down  merry 
gentlemen  that's enough 
you've got my arm  you've got my arm 
  what is that    nothing  it's just a wisp of cloud 
it's moving fast 
against the wind 
  crebain from dunland    hide 
  hurry    take cover 
spies of saruman 
the passage south is being watched 
we must take the pass of caradhras 
frodo 
boromir 
it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt   
   over so small a thing 
such a little thing 
boromir 
give the ring to frodo 
as you wish 
i care not 
so  gandalf  you try to lead them over caradhras 
and if that fails  where then will you go 
 i if the mountain defeats you     i 
 i    will you risk a more dangerous road   i 
there is a fell voice on the air 
it's saruman 
he's trying to bring down the mountain  gandalf  we must turn back 
no 
we must get off the mountain 
make for the gap of rohan  and take the west road to my city 
the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard 
we cannot pass over a mountain  let us go under it 
let us go through the mines of moria 
 i moria  you fear to go into those mines   i 
the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep 
 i you know what they awoke in the darkness of khazad dÃ£ m   i 
shadow and flame 
let the ring bearer decide 
we cannot stay here 
this will be the death of the hobbits 
frodo 
we will go through the mines 
so be it 
frodo  come and help an old man 
how is your shoulder 
  better than it was    and the ring 
you feel its power growing  don't you 
i've felt it too  you must be careful now 
evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship 
and  i fear  from within 
  who then do i trust    you must trust yourself 
trust your own strengths 
  what do you mean    there are many powers in this world   
   for good or for evil 
some are greater than i am 
and against some i have not yet been tested 
the walls   
   of moria 
dwarf doors are invisible when closed 
their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten 
why doesn't that surprise me 
well  let's see 
ithildin 
it mirrors only starlight and moonlight 
it reads   the doors of durin  lord of moria 
  speak  friend  and enter     what do you suppose that means 
it's simple  if you are a friend  you speak the password and the doors will open 
nothing's happening 
i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves   
   men and orcs 
what are you going to do  then 
knock your head against these doors  peregrin took 
and if that does not shatter them   
   and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions   
   i will try to find the opening words 
mines are no place for a pony 
  even one so brave as bill    bye bye  bill 
go on  bill  go on 
don't worry  sam  he knows the way home 
do not disturb the water 
oh  it's useless 
it's a riddle 
 speak 'friend' and enter  
what's the elvish word for  friend  
 i mellon   i 
soon  master elf  you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves 
roaring fires  malt beer  ripe meat off the bone 
this  my friend  is the home of my cousin balin 
and they call it a mine 
a mine 
this is no mine  it's a tomb 
no 
no   
no 
goblins 
we make for the gap of rohan  we should never have come here 
now  get out of here  get out 
  frodo    help 
strider 
  help    get off him 
aragorn 
frodo 
strider 
into the mines 
  legolas    into the cave 
run 
we now have but one choice 
we must face the long dark of moria 
be on your guard 
there are older and fouler things than orcs   
   in the deep places of the world 
quietly now  it's a four day journey to the other side 
let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed 
the wealth of moria is not in gold   
   or jewels   
   but mithril 
bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that thorin gave him 
  oh  that was a kingly gift    yes 
i never told him   
   but its worth was greater than the value of the shire 
pippin 
i have no memory of this place 
  are we lost    no 
  i think we are    gandalf's thinking 
  merry    what 
i'm hungry 
  there's something down there    it's gollum 
  gollum    he's been following us for three days 
  he escaped the dungeons of barad dÃ£ r    escaped   
   or was set loose 
now the ring has brought him here 
he will never be rid of his need for it 
he hates and loves the ring  as he hates and loves himself 
smÃ£ agol's life is a sad story 
yes  smÃ£ agol he was once called  before the ring found him 
before it drove him mad 
it's a pity bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance 
pity 
it is pity that stayed bilbo's hand 
many that live deserve death  some that die deserve life 
can you give it to them  frodo 
do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment 
even the very wise cannot see all ends 
my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet  for good or ill   
   before this is over 
the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many 
i wish the ring had never come to me 
i wish none of this had happened 
so do all who live to see such times  but that is not for them to decide 
all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us 
there are other forces at work in this world  frodo  besides the will of evil 
bilbo was meant to find the ring 
in which case  you also were meant to have it 
and that is an encouraging thought 
ah 
it's that way 
  he's remembered    no 
but the air doesn't smell so foul down here 
if in doubt  meriadoc  always follow your nose 
let me risk a little more light 
behold   
   the great realm and dwarf city of dwarrowdelf 
there's an eye opener  and no mistake 
gimli 
no 
no 
oh  no 
no 
 here lies balin   
   son of fundin   
   lord of moria  
he is dead  then 
it's as i feared 
we must move on  we cannot linger 
 they have taken the bridge and the second hall 
we have barred the gates   
   but cannot hold them for long 
the ground shakes 
drums   
   drums in the deep 
we cannot get out 
a shadow moves in the dark 
we cannot get out 
they are coming  
fool of a took 
throw yourself in next time  and rid us of your stupidity 
frodo 
orcs 
get back  stay close to gandalf 
they have a cave troll 
let them come 
there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath 
i think i'm getting the hang of this 
frodo 
aragorn  aragorn 
frodo 
frodo 
frodo 
oh  no 
he's alive 
i'm all right  i'm not hurt 
you should be dead 
that spear would have skewered a wild boar 
i think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye 
mithril 
you are full of surprises  master baggins 
to the bridge of khazad dÃ£ m 
this way 
what is this new devilry 
a balrog 
a demon of the ancient world 
this foe is beyond any of you 
run 
quickly 
gandalf 
lead them on  aragorn 
the bridge is near 
do as i say  swords are no more use here 
gandalf 
merry  pippin 
sam 
nobody tosses a dwarf 
not the beard 
steady 
hold on 
hang on 
lean forward 
steady 
come on 
now 
over the bridge 
fly 
you cannot pass 
gandalf 
i am a servant of the secret fire  wielder of the flame of anor 
the dark fire will not avail you  flame of udÃ£ n 
go back to the shadow 
you shall not pass 
  no  no    gandalf 
fly  you fools 
no 
aragorn 
legolas  get them up 
give them a moment  for pity's sake 
by nightfall  these hills will be swarming with orcs 
we must reach the woods of lothlÃ£Â³rien 
come  boromir  legolas  gimli  get them up 
on your feet  sam 
frodo 
frodo 
stay close  young hobbits 
they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods 
an elf witch   
   of terrible power 
all who look upon her   
   fall under her spell 
 i frodo   i 
and are never seen again 
 i your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom   i 
 i you bring great evil here  ring bearer   i 
mr  frodo 
well  here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily 
i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox 
the dwarf breathes so loud  we could have shot him in the dark 
so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves 
speak words we can all understand 
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days 
and you know what this dwarf says to that 
that was not so courteous 
you bring great evil with you 
you can go no further 
gandalf's death was not in vain 
nor would he have you give up hope 
you carry a heavy burden  frodo 
don't carry the weight of the dead 
you will follow me 
caras galadhon 
the heart of elvendom on earth 
realm of the lord celeborn and of galadriel  lady of light 
the enemy knows you have entered here 
what hope you had in secrecy is now gone 
eight there are here  yet nine there were set out from rivendell 
tell me  where is gandalf 
for i much desire to speak with him 
i can no longer see him from afar 
gandalf the grey did not pass the borders of this land 
he has fallen into shadow 
he was taken by both shadow and flame 
a balrog of morgoth 
for we went needlessly into the net of moria 
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life 
we do not yet know his full purpose 
do not let the great emptiness of khazad dÃ£ m fill your heart   
   gimli  son of glÃ£Â³in 
for the world has grown full of peril   
   and in all lands   
   love is now mingled with grief 
what now becomes of this fellowship 
without gandalf  hope is lost 
the quest stands upon the edge of a knife 
stray but a little and it will fail   
   to the ruin of all 
yet hope remains while the company is true 
do not let your hearts be troubled  go now and rest   
   for you are weary with sorrow and much toil 
tonight  you will sleep   
 i welcome  frodo of the shire     i 
 i    one who has seen the eye   i 
a lament for gandalf 
what do they say about him 
i have not the heart to tell you 
for me  the grief is still too near 
i bet they don't mention his fireworks 
there should be a verse about them 
 i the finest rockets ever seen  i 
 i they burst in stars of blue and green  i 
 i or after thunder  silver showers  i 
 i came falling like a rain of flowers  i 
oh  that doesn't do them justice by a long road 
take some rest 
these borders are well protected 
i will find no rest here 
i heard her voice inside my head 
she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor 
she said to me   even now there is hope left  
but i cannot see it 
it is long since we had any hope 
my father is a noble man 
but his rule is failing   
   and our people lose faith 
he looks to me to make things right  and i would do it 
i would see the glory of gondor restored 
have you ever seen it  aragorn 
the white tower of ecthelion 
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver 
its banners caught high in the morning breeze 
have you ever been called home   
   by the clear ringing of silver trumpets 
i have seen the white city   
   long ago 
one day  our paths will lead us there 
and the tower guard shall take up the call 
 the lords of gondor have returned  
will you look into the mirror 
what will i see 
even the wisest cannot tell 
for the mirror   
   shows many things 
things that were   
   things that are   
   and some things   
   that have not yet come to pass 
i know what it is you saw 
for it is also in my mind 
 i it is what will come to pass if you should fail   i 
 i the fellowship is breaking  it is already begun   i 
 i he will try to take the ring   i 
 i you know of whom i speak   i 
 i one by one  it will destroy them all   i 
 i if you ask it of me     i 
 i    i will give you the one ring   i 
you offer it to me freely 
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this 
in place of a dark lord  you would have a queen   
   not dark but beautiful  and terrible as the dawn 
treacherous as the sea 
stronger than the foundations of the earth 
all shall love me   
   and despair 
i pass the test  i will diminish   
   and go into the west   
     and remain galadriel    i cannot do this alone 
you are a ring bearer  frodo  to bear a ring of power   
   is to be alone 
this is nenya  the ring of adamant 
and i am its keeper 
this task was appointed to you 
and if you do not find a way   
   no one will 
then i know what i must do 
it's just   
   i'm afraid to do it 
even the smallest person can change the course of the future 
do you know how the orcs first came into being 
they were elves once 
taken by the dark powers   
   tortured and mutilated 
a ruined and terrible form of life 
and now   
   perfected 
my fighting uruk hai   
   whom do you serve 
saruman 
hunt them down  do not stop until they are found 
you do not know pain  you do not know fear 
you will taste man flesh 
one of the halflings carries something of great value 
bring them to me alive and unspoiled 
kill the others 
never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people 
may these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes 
lembas 
elvish waybread 
one small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man 
how many did you eat 
four 
 i every league you travel south  the danger will increase   i 
 i mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the anduin   i 
 i nor will you find safety on the western bank   i 
strange creatures bearing the white hand have been seen on our borders 
seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun  yet these have done so 
by river you have the chance   
   of outrunning the enemy to the falls of rauros 
my gift for you  legolas  is a bow of the galadhrim 
worthy of the skill of our woodland kin 
these are the daggers of the noldorin 
they have already seen service in war 
do not fear  young peregrin took 
 i you will find your courage   i 
 i and for you  samwise gamgee     i 
   elven rope made of hithlain 
thank you  my lady 
have you run out of those nice  shiny daggers 
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves 
nothing 
except to look upon the lady of the galadhrim one last time   
   for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth 
actually   
there was one thing 
no  no  i'm talking nonsense  it's quite impossible 
 i stupid to ask   i 
 i i have nothing greater to give     i 
   than the gift you already bear 
that choice is yet before her 
you have your own choice to make  aragorn 
to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of elendil   
   or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin 
 i farewell  frodo baggins   i 
i give you the light of eÃ£ rendil   
   our most beloved star 
 i may it be a light for you in dark places     i 
 i    when all other lights go out   i 
i have taken my worst wound at this parting   
   having looked my last upon that which is fairest 
henceforth i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me 
what was her gift 
i asked her for one hair from her golden head 
she gave me three 
gollum  he has tracked us since moria 
i had hoped we would lose him on the river 
but he's too clever a waterman 
and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts   
   it will make the crossing even more dangerous 
have some food  mr  frodo 
  no  sam    you haven't eaten anything all day 
you're not sleeping  neither  don't think i haven't noticed 
  mr  frodo     i'm all right 
but you're not 
i'm here to help you 
i promised gandalf that i would 
you can't help me  sam 
not this time 
get some sleep 
minas tirith is the safer road 
you know that  from there we can regroup 
strike out for mordor from a place of strength 
there is no strength in gondor that can avail us 
you were quick enough to trust the elves 
have you so little faith in your own people 
yes  there is weakness  there is frailty 
but there is courage also  and honor to be found in men 
but you will not see that 
you are afraid 
all your life  you have hidden in the shadows 
scared of who you are  of what you are 
i will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city 
frodo 
the argonath 
long have i desired to look upon the kings of old 
my kin 
we cross the lake at nightfall 
hide the boats and continue on foot 
  we approach mordor from the north    oh  yes 
just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil   
   an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks 
and after that  it gets even better 
festering  stinking marshland as far as the eye can see 
that is our road 
i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength  master dwarf 
recover my  
  we should leave now    no 
orcs patrol the eastern shore  we must wait for cover of darkness 
it is not the eastern shore that worries me 
a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind 
something draws near  i can feel it 
recover strength  pay no heed to that  young hobbit 
where's frodo 
none of us should wander alone 
you  least of all 
so much depends on you 
frodo 
i know why you seek solitude 
you suffer  i see it day by day 
you sure you do not suffer needlessly 
there are other ways  frodo 
  other paths that we might take    i know what you would say 
it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart 
warning  against what 
we're all afraid  frodo 
but to let that fear drive us  to destroy what hope we have   
     don't you see that is madness    there is no other way 
i ask only for the strength to defend my people 
  if you would but lend me the ring    no 
  why do you recoil  i am no thief    you are not yourself 
what chance do you think you have 
they will find you  they will take the ring 
and you will beg for death before the end 
you fool 
it is not yours  save by unhappy chance  it could have been mine 
it should be mine  give it to me 
  give it to me    no 
  give it to me    no 
i see your mind 
you will take the ring to sauron 
you will betray us 
you'll go to your death  and the death of us all 
curse you  curse you and all the halflings 
frodo 
frodo 
what have i done 
please  frodo 
frodo  i'm sorry 
frodo 
frodo 
  it has taken boromir    where is the ring 
stay away 
frodo 
  i swore to protect you    can you protect me from yourself 
would you destroy it 
 i aragorn   i 
 i aragorn   i 
 i elessar   i 
i would have gone with you to the end 
into the very fires of mordor 
i know 
look after the others  especially sam  he will not understand 
go  frodo 
run 
run 
mr  frodo 
find the halfling 
find the halfling 
elendil 
aragorn  go 
frodo 
hide here  quick 
come on 
what's he doing 
he's leaving 
  no    pippin 
run  frodo  go on 
  hey  hey  you    over here 
  over here    this way 
  it's working    i know it's working  run 
  the horn of gondor    boromir 
run 
no 
  they took the little ones    hold still 
frodo  where is frodo 
i let frodo go 
then you did what i could not 
i tried to take the ring from him 
  the ring is beyond our reach now    forgive me 
i did not see it 
  i have failed you all    no  boromir 
you fought bravely 
you have kept your honor 
leave it 
it is over 
the world of men will fall  and all will come to darkness   
   and my city to ruin 
i do not know what strength is in my blood   
   but i swear to you  i will not let the white city fall   
   nor our people fail 
our people 
our people 
i would have followed you  my brother 
my captain 
my king 
be at peace   
   son of gondor 
they will look for his coming from the white tower 
but he will not return 
frodo 
 i i wish the ring had never come to me   i 
 i i wish none of this had happened   i 
 i so do all who live to see such times     i 
 i    but that is not for them to decide   i 
 i all you have to decide     i 
   is what to do with the time that is given to you 
frodo  no 
frodo 
  mr  frodo    no  sam 
go back  sam 
  i'm going to mordor alone    of course you are 
and i'm coming with you 
you can't swim 
sam 
sam 
i made a promise  mr  frodo 
a promise   don't you leave him  samwise gamgee  
and i don't mean to 
i don't mean to 
sam 
come on 
hurry  frodo and sam have reached the eastern shore 
  you mean not to follow them    frodo's fate is no longer in our hands 
then it has all been in vain  the fellowship has failed 
not if we hold true to each other 
we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death 
not while we have strength left  leave all that can be spared behind 
we travel light 
let us hunt some orc 
yes 
mordor 
i hope the others find a safer road 
strider will look after them 
i don't suppose we'll ever see them again 
we may yet  mr  frodo 
we may 
sam   
   i'm glad you are with me
